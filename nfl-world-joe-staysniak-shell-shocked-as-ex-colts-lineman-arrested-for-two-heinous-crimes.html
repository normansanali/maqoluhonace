Former <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Indianapolis Colts</a> offensive lineman Joe Staysniak has landed himself in a significant amount of it after authorities levied multiple charges against him owing to a domestic violence incident. But what did he do, so much so, that the police booked him?</p><p>Cops arrested Staysniak on Tuesday after a heated situation involving his son, Lucas Staysniak, and his son’s acquaintance. The Hendricks County police came to the scene after a “delayed domestic” incident, resulting in a registered affidavit against the former NFL athlete and radio host.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Joe Staysniak ends up in a domestic dispute</h2><p>The San Diego Chargers and Indianapolis pass rush blocker faces strangulation and battery charges after he attempted to choke his son’s alleged boyfriend and also punched his lips bloody.

The charges against him included battery, firearm pointing, strangulation, intimidation, and domestic battery. Lucas Staysniak informed the police that he was sitting with his friend in a parked car on the premises when Joe started the ruckus.</p><p>“His [Lucas’] father opened the rear right passenger door and that when he did this, he grabbed [passenger’s] hood and was choking him. Lucas stated that his father then punched him, causing his lip to bleed and then punched [passenger]. He stated that his father then displayed a firearm and told him and [passenger] that they were lucky he saw who it was,” <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>the official probable cause affidavit said</a>.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Fans assumed a homophobia angle but Joe cleared all doubts</h2><p>According to the 56-year-old sports radio personality and former host of the WFNI’s ‘The Fan Morning Show’, this was all a big misunderstanding. Joe Staysniak received a call from his neighbors about a suspicious vehicle parked in front of his property. And Joe assumed the worst, leading to the altercation with his son and his friend. Fans were quick to assume homophobia was the cause. However, it was plain old home security at the root of it.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"Well, Joe Staysniak sure showed us how to be a role model!"</p><p>— NFT Obzerver (@NFTobzerver) <a href=#>February 22, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>13 News had group editorial debate about that. One or both young men involved may be juveniles/in high school. Joe’s motivations are not stated in court records. I tried to reach him to ask. Some of the factors considered. This is where we landed for now.</p><p>— Rich Nye (@RichNye13) <a href=#>February 22, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>2 reasons I called him Joe at times in the story. He is well known as a player and radio host for years. Also, there are two Staysniaks in the story. So Joe actually provides some clarity. I would call Joe an acquaintance from years of covering him as a Colt & working in media.</p><p>— Rich Nye (@RichNye13) <a href=#>February 22, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Joe Staysniak’s attorney, Guy Relford, issued a statement about his client’s arrest. “We are completely confident that Joe’s actions will be conclusively determined to be legal & justified under the circumstances.” See below: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/URIP7IM55R</a></p><p>— Rich Nye (@RichNye13) <a href=#>February 22, 2023</a></p><p>Staysniak admitted to flashing the firearm but denied using it to threaten anybody with it. Joe’s lawyer Guy Relford also came out with an official statement.</p><p>WATCH THIS STORY: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Patrick Mahomes answers whether Rihanna should name her baby after him</a></p><p>Seems like a quick resolution of the entire matter. And nothing like <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Antonio Brown’s long-drawn altercation with the Tampa police a few months ago</a>. Hopefully, Joe and his son Lucas can bury the hatchet of confusion and move on from this episode.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82fo2avn6e5pXnJqJxmq6SWxrS6yJqiZquYmrmtedKhppyjlZl6or%2BMnq9mm5%2BhwbR5y6KlnqWRo3qivtGeqq2dlGKzsL6Mra6oZZiatq%2B71KxknKqZorK0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./history-news-september-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Interesting History News From September 2023 With History Uncovered</span></a>
