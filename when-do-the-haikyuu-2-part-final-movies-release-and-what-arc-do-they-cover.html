When a mysterious countdown started on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">official Haikyuu!! site</a> on Aug. 8, fans‚Äô hopes for the awaited season were raised. However,&nbsp;that hope would later be crushed, when on Aug. 13, an unexpected revelation was finally made. As it turns out, Haikyuu!!‚Äòs two-part final movies are currently in production, and a teaser trailer is already available to watch.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, this announcement has left a great majority of fans disappointed, as they believe this project will not be enough to wrap up the anime in a satisfying way. They soon took to social media to express their opinions on the matter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>The whole scene rn üò≠ <a href=#>#Haikyuu</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/P2MHsYvntr</a></p>‚Äî chibi chan (@sunsetkuroo) <a href=#>August 13, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>"i apologize for the person i'll become when this panel gets animated"<br>haikyuu animators: don't worry, it's not getting animated</p>‚Äî Ÿã (@suckerforyuu) <a href=#>August 13, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=580 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>Because there are still many manga chapters to be adapted on screen (more than would probably be possible to contain in two movies), some fans remain hopeful for a season five announcement, speculating that it might happen on Haikyuu!! day, Aug. 19. However, considering the movie‚Äôs title, things don‚Äôt seem to be looking good. As for the movie‚Äôs release, at this point, a definite date has not yet been announced. However, a kickoff event has been confirmed for August 2023 by the anime‚Äôs <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">official Twitter</a>, and it‚Äôs stated that more news will soon be available.</p><h2 id=h-what-arc-s-will-the-two-movies-cover data-injectable=false>What arc(s) will the two movies cover</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Haikyuu-hinata-kageyama.jpg><p data-characters=638 data-current-count=938 data-injectable=true>If no new season is released until then, it‚Äôs likely that the movies will pick up right where season four left off, with the much-anticipated adaptation of the Spring Nationals match between viewers‚Äô favorite teams: Karasuno and Nekoma. This theory is backed up by the trailer, since it features manga panels from this exact match, leading to the obvious conclusion that they will be animated. Examining the trailer further, it‚Äôs also possible to see panels from the Rio de Janeiro arc, where Hinata pursues his love for beach volleyball and a final panel of the match between the Black Jackals and the Schweden Adlers.</p><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>This match promises to get viewers on the edge of their seats, as Haikyuu!!‚Äòs two main protagonists, Hinata and Kageyama, finally come full circle and face off against each other in court once more. Taking into account that this match wraps up the manga‚Äôs penultimate chapter, it‚Äôs not far-fetched to consider that Production I.G. might try to condense all remaining arcs into the movies. However, only time can tell how successful that endeavor will be.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>And there you have it, all the information that is available on the Haikyuu!! final movies as of now. If you‚Äôre a fan of this anime series, stay tuned for more, and don‚Äôt be discouraged by the lack of a season five ‚Äî these movies might just exceed everyone‚Äôs expectations!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn56mXZm8bsDHnmShmZmgxrbBjGtkqZmiqXqntc2ao2aln6u2pr%2BMq5ylnZGosm6tzZ1ksKCRqXqivsJmm6hlpJ2yunnCqK2eql8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./two-days-copenhagen.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Two days in Copenhagen</span></a>
