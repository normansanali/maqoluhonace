For years, there were rumors about what happened between the Murder Inc Records boss and his chart-topping artist. Much of the gossip was laid to rest after Irv spoke openly in the press about their short-lived romance. This includes his allegations that he realized their relationship was over once he saw Ashanti at an NBA game with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Nelly</a>. To provide a comprehensive account of this complex and fascinating tale, we'll take a deep dive into the duo's history, the music they created, and where they are today.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-their-meeting-the-rise-of-murder-inc-records>Their Meeting & The Rise of Murder Inc Records</h2></span><p>Irv Gotti, born Irving Domingo Lorenzo Jr., first encountered Ashanti, born Ashanti Shequoiya Douglas, in the late 1990s. At the time, Gotti was building his record label, Murder Inc, which would go on to sign some of the biggest names in hip-hop and R&B, including <a href=# class=text-word rel>Ja Rule</a>, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lloyd</a>, and Ashanti herself. Ashanti was starting her career, and under Gotti's guidance, she quickly became a major force in the industry.</p><p>Their partnership led to several chart-topping hits, with Ashanti releasing her self-titled debut album in 2002, which featured the hit singles "Foolish," "Happy," and "Baby." She won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album in 2003 and became integral to <a href=# rel>Murder Inc's success</a>. The two continued to work closely together, and rumors began to swirl about their romantic relationship.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Rumored Romance</h2></span><p>For years, fans speculated about the nature of Irv Gotti and Ashanti's relationship. Word on the street was that Irv and Ashanti carried on a relationship while he was still married. Although Gotti would repeatedly deny the allegations, it didn't stop the chatter from circulating. He once again put a stop to the rumors last year while promoting his Murder Inc. documentary. Ashanti would not be a part of the series, as there was rumored tension between the singer and her former label boss.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Breakup & Fallout</h2></span><p>The ups and downs of their relationship <a href=# rel>have been well-documented</a>, thanks to Irv. He appeared on Drink Champs and detailed that time in his life. He claimed that he and Ashanti were deeply in love, but like many hip hop romances go, things didn't work out. Following her love affair with Gotti, <a href=# rel>Ashanti began dating Nelly</a>. Irv later claimed he found out about their relationship while watching television. He said while tuned into a basketball game, he heard the announcer highlight Ashanti and Nelly sitting courtside together.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where They Are Today</h2></span><p>Irv Gotti would go on to receive a <a href=# rel>wave of backlash</a> for some of the more recent comments he made about Ashanti. The public didn't appreciate some of his details regarding their private moments. He would later apologize for his candor. Meanwhile, Ashanti laughed off Irv's remarks but did explain to Angie Martinez that things were not as her former flame made them seem.</p><p>Interestingly enough, the singer, producer, actress, and all-around media maven would have an unexpected reunion. Following the most recent Irv Gotti fallout, it looks like Ashanti and Nelly <a href=# rel>have once again reunited</a>. The pair dated for over a decade before calling it quits. All these years later and rumors state they're back together. Nelly and Ashanti recently were also spotted holding hands at a boxing match, and it was said that their rep confirmed they were "very happy." No word on how Irv feels about the news.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaYV4hZdmrqGZpGK1orzPnqWenF2XsrXDxJ6lZqGiq3qou9OtoGaZo52ur8DI</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./was-matthew-perry-married-relationship-status-before-death.html><span>←</span><span>Was Matthew Perry Married?
