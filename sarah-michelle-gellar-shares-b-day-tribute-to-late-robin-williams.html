Williams’ widow, <strong>Susan Schneider Williams</strong>, opened up about his death in an interview in November 2016, and revealed that he had <a href=#>suffered from Lewy body dementia</a>. The graphic designer explained that, despite reports, she believes the Oscar winner didn’t take his own life due to his depression.</p><p>“[Parkinson’s disease] is actually an accurate diagnosis; however, that was the clinical side. The pathology was that he had diffuse Lewy body disease, which is what took him,” Schneider Williams, 55, told CBS This Morning at the time. “I can tell you in his autopsy, the coroner’s report was clear that he had Lewy body throughout all of his brain and brain stem — nearly every region.”</p><p>Williams is survived by Schneider Williams and his adult children, <strong>Zelda</strong>, <strong>Zac</strong> and <strong>Cody</strong>, from previous relationships.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmaKWtW65yJyfnqScmnqosculmKtlo52us7HSZplmnJGuerW%2ByJusrZ1dqbxuuMCtnGaqn5e2r3nWoqOloZGiwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rajinikanth-2.html><span>←</span><span>Rajinikanth Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Children, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
