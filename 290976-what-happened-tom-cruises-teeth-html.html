While his handsome looks helped him succeed in the film industry, Cruise wasn't blessed with perfect teeth.</p><p class=dh>"Top Gun: Maverick" star Danny Ramirez recently opened up about working with Cruise, describing him as a mentor. Ramirez said working on the set of the box-office hit was "one of the most amazing experiences" he has had.</p><p class=dh>The actor portrayed Lieutenant Mickey "Fanboy" Garcia and underwent unique training for the role. Ramirez likened his experience working on the movie to getting a master's degree or a doctorate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a00903c7b3d854cf581327ad19c42ea3.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Tom Cruise attends the screening of "Top Gun: Maverick" during the 75th annual Cannes film festival at Palais des Festivals on May 18, 2022, in Cannes, France. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WHY DOES TOM CRUISE HAVE A MIDDLE TOOTH?</strong></p><p class=dh>When he was a kid, a hockey puck hit Cruise in the face and chipped his front tooth. He had a cap placed to cover the chipped part. But early in his career, he reportedly had the cap removed for <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.ladbible.com/news/tv-and-film-man-discovers-secret-behind-tom-cruises-smile-20210330>his role</a> in the film "The Outsiders."</p><p class=dh>At the time, he thought his asymmetrical tooth worked well for the character.

Fresh from his breakup with actress Nicole Kidman in 2001, Cruise was pictured wearing braces.</p><p class=dh>He reportedly had a crown fitted before wearing braces to straighten his teeth. He kept his braces while walking the red carpet at the premiere of his 2002 film "Minority Report."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DOES TOM CRUISE WEAR HEELS?</strong></p><p class=dh>For a long time, eagle-eyed fans have been curious whether Cruise wears heels because at every social event he went to, his height would nearly match that of his other female celebrities who are naturally taller than him.</p><p class=dh>In 2010, Cruise and actress Cameron Diaz were photographed together on the red carpet for their promotional movie "Knight & Day."
