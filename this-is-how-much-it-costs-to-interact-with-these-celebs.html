Back in 2014, a source cited by&nbsp;<a href=#>Radar Online</a>&nbsp;claimed that participants were only allowed to spend mere seconds with the star and were prohibited from touching or hugging her "without her permission," as well as from "[bringing] her any gifts." Spears also allegedly seemed uncomfortable while interacting with fans, with the media outlet's insider alleging that she reportedly "barely spoke" and "just smiled and nodded and said 'Thank you' a lot."</p><p>The "Toxic" singer faced a similar backlash for her meet-and-greet prices in 2018, as disappointed potential buyers <a href=#>voiced their complaints</a> on Twitter, with one disgruntled user <a href=#>quipping</a>, "They should really call it the 'Piece Of You' Tour, since you'll need to sell an organ to afford to go. Truly a joke."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2hoaH93e9OhoKxlmah6qbvWZqSum5hitrV5wqiqratdqbxutc2tnKuZk6l6uLXToWStoJWosm6vxKWcm6tf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-great-recap-season-3-episode-9-destiny-episode-10-once-upon-a-time-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Great Season-Finale Recap: Everybody Wants to Rule the World</span></a>
