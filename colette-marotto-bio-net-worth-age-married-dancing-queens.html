The show follows the dancers as they invest their time and money into their all-consuming passion to vie for the top spots, respect, and recognition in the world of Pro-Am dance competitions,” a press release states.</p><p>“Pro-Am combines amateur dancers competing with professional partners. These highly skilled amateur dancers spend tens of thousands of dollars on their hair, makeup, and outfits, plus the expenses for their professional partners to practice, travel, and compete.”</p><p>Colette is a “business owner and single mother to a son with special needs, Colette has a lot of stress in her life and dancing allows her to focus on herself and forget her responsibilities. Recently, her pro dance partner left her to compete with Pooja, forcing her to find a new pro, Oleksiy “Alex” Pigotskyy, and start from scratch. Her ballroom breakup created tension between the women and lit a fire within Colette to become even more successful and prove to her former pro that she can win without him.”</p><p>Kristijan Burazer worked with Colette for nearly two years before moving on to work with Pooja. “Everything was going well,” Colette says, “but he just decided it’d go better with a different partner.” She got partner-dumped!
