His post gave fans a rare glimpse at the artist's family, as he's rarely seen alongside all of his kids at once. Though several commenters raced to the comments section to dote on the father, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">others were critical</a> of the size of his family. His post even sparked comparisons between him and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nick Cannon</a>, who is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">famously a father of 12</a>. Ne-Yo shares two children with his former fiancée Monyetta Shaw, Madilyn and Mason. He also has three children with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his ex-wife Crystal Renay</a>, Isabella, Shaffer, and Roman. He shares his two youngest children, Braiden and Brixton, with his ex Sade Bagnerise. Allegedly, he fathered his children with Bagnerise while still married to Renay, which she would later cite as the reason for their divorce.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"He trying to catch up with Eddie Murphy & Nick Cannon," one Instagram user commented on the post. "Close to [Nick Cannon]," another notes alongside laughing emojis. One Twitter user chimed in to defend Ne-Yo. "People comparing him to Nick Cannon. Nick Cannon has 12 kids with six women, 9 of whom were born over a 3-year period. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Nick is in his own league,</a>" they wrote.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ne-yo-says-he-s-a-father-before-anything-else>Ne-Yo Says He's A "<a href=# class=text-word>Father</a> Before Anything Else"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Last month, Ne-Yo filed for joint custody of his two kids with Bagnerise. She agreed to allow Ne-Yo to gain partial custody of the children in exchange for <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">child support payments</a>. "He has always been physically, financially, and emotionally responsible for both Braiden and Brixton from the moment he found out about the first pregnancy," Bagnerise later said about the singer. "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">He be scandalous AF</a> lmao but he does right by all of his kids," she added.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Although several users criticized the singer for choosing to have so many kids, others are just happy he's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">making an effort to be a good father</a>. "I’m a FATHER before I’m anything else," Ne-Yo captioned his post, "Not money, not fame, not even the love of the craft. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I do this for THEM.</a>"</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Caroline Fisher is a News Writer at HotNewHipHop from Chicago, Illinois.
