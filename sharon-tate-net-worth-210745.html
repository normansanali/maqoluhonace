When she lived in Italy, she was voted "Homecoming Queen" of her high school. After being an extra in a few Italian films, Sharon headed to Hollywood where she would again start as an extra. Her first big break came when she was cast as the shapely bank secretary, "Janet Trego", in the television series The Beverly Hillbillies (1962) (1963-1965). In 1967, she would meet her future husband, director Roman Polanski, on the set of the English film Dance of the Vampires (1967). Sharon's big role would be that same year when she was the starlet in Valley of the Dolls (1967). With her marriage to Roman, her life became one of parties, travel and meeting influential movie people. She would appear as a red-haired beauty in the spy spoof The Wrecking Crew (1969) working with Dean Martin and the equally beautiful Elke Sommer. Sharon was 2 months pregnant of her first child while filming in Italy and France a funny Italian comedy movie "Una su Tredici" (12 + 1 (1969)) in February 1969. On August 9, 1969 Sharon Tate, Abigail Folger, Jay Sebring, Steve Parent and Voytek Frykowski were murdered by 3 of <a href=#>Charles Manson</a>'s followers: Charles Watson, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel. Today all of her killers remain in prison.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmejna6zu81mq5qslWK7psCMsKarrJhif3J8lm1s</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./phil-rosenthal-somebody-feed-phil-season-3-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Phil From Somebody Feed Phil Is So Grateful for Takeout Right Now</span></a>
