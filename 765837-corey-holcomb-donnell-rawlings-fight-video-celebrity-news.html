After Donnell Rawlings finished his set, 55-year-old Corey Holcomb had some jokes to get off, though he notably used his time behind the mic to diss both Rawlings and his friend Dave Chappelle. In a video obtained by TMZ, Holcomb's audience didn't seem receptive to him <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">cracking jokes</a> at other Black men's expense, specifically failing to laugh when he called Chappelle and Rawlings "mild."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The father of three admitted he might be in the wrong for his comments, but that didn't stop him from continuing on with his set. What did bring things to a halt was Rawlings' reaction to the hatred, causing him to stand up out of his seat and curse Holcomb out. "I catch you up in all these rooms in f**king Brooklyn and you ain't ever f**ked with [unintelligible]... You wanna talk about it? You saying I'm mild, you saying I ain't come through the streets or the gutters is straight bulls**t."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-donnell-rawlings-defends-dave-chappelle-from-corey-holcomb>Donnell Rawlings Defends Dave Chappelle from Corey Holcomb</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Another comment that upset Rawlings is Holcomb's claim that any comedian who has appeared in three or more movies "has had to perform fellatio on someone" in the entertainment industry. The Wire actor takes this personally, as he has several film credits on his resume, but has never engaged in any sort of sexual favours for them to come to fruition.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It seems that part of what brought Dave Chappelle and Donell Rawlings together as friends may have been their shared need to speak up for <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">what they feel is right</a>. Before the latter defended the former from Corey Holcomb, Chappelle called out Katt Williams for berating several Black comics in his viral Club Shay Shay interview.
