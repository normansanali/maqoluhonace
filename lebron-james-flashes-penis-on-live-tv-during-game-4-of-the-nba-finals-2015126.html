Cleveland Cavaliers’ superstar <strong>LeBron James</strong> became a trending topic across the Internet on Thursday, June 11, and it wasn’t because of his usual athletic prowess. The NBA star was part of a team huddle when he accidentally flashed his penis on live television before millions of viewers tuning in to Game 4 of the NBA Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors.</p><p>During the ABC live broadcast, James’ junk was (very quickly!) shown on TV when cameras panned to the star athlete adjusting his compression shorts. According to <a href=#>NBC News</a>, the basketball star exposed himself to approximately 18.5 million viewers, based on the average number of people who tuned in during each of the first three games.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=395 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="lebron james" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Immediately, viewers took to Twitter to call out the incident.

Following the debacle, the FCC slapped CBS with a hefty $550,000 fine for the exposure, although the Supreme Court later voided the charge.</p><p>James’ accidental flashing wasn’t his only big moment of the night, though. He also had a hard head-on collision with a camera, which resulted in the player needing stitches. “I had a slight headache, which I think every one of you guys would probably have if you ran into a camera,” James, whose team lost the game on Thursday night, told USA Today. “Like I said, I got a few stitches and I got a slight headache right now but I’ll be fine with that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalnZKnvK95yZqknqtdm7miv8eeqmaolaO2tHnOp2SloaaaerXCjJ2sq6GenHqorcyeZG1ln5t6tbTEZqWbmV2btq%2Bty6xka2hhan5zgo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katie-cassidy-is-open-to-stephen-huszar-engagement-after-divorce.html><span>←</span><span>Katie Cassidy Is Open to Stephen Huszar Engagement After Divorce</span></a>
