Twitter fingers were flying when <b>Lil’ Kim</b> posted an April 24 photo collage on Instagram. The “Magic Stick” emcee, 41, <a href=#>looked unrecognizable</a> with her very pale skin, slim nose and long blonde hair.&nbsp;</p><p>“Dark skinned Lil Kim was perfection… I don’t know who this woman is anymore,” a dismayed fan tweeted.</p><p><a href=#>Miami Heat!!! ???</a></p><p>A post shared by Lil’ Kim (@lilkimthequeenbee) on Apr 24, 2016 at 3:11pm PDT</p><p>Dr. <b>Jennifer Levine</b>, a board-certified plastic surgeon, can spot the differences too. “It’s clear that there has been some skin bleaching. She’s probably used chemicals, which contain very high doses of acids, on her face, combined with high-acid creams to lighten her skin,” she tells <i>Us Weekly.</i></p><p>Levine, who’s based in New York City, adds that Kim has probably had her eyes done as well: “They seem elongated and completely different,” she observes. “Kim would have had to have surgery to remove the fat, skin and tissue to create this new eye shape.”</p><p>Kim’s numerous nose augmentations are no secret, either. In a <a href=#>2005 interview</a>, the hip-hop star (real name: Kimberly Denise Jones) told <b>Angie Martinez</b> that she went under the knife after an abusive ex-boyfriend broke her nose. But the biggest differences, according to Levine, are “to her jawline. She could have had Botox injections under the jaw for a more chiseled look,“ she tells <i>Us</i>. “And in case it’s not obvious, Kim probably had filler injected into her cheeks.”</p><p>But while Kim’s new face is undeniable, Levine believes that the Queen Bee is also likely guilty of committing the social-media sin that we’re all guilty of: filtering!</p><span class=caption></span><p>“It looks like a lot of Photoshop to me,” she tells <i>Us</i> of the talked-about weekend photos. “When you look at earlier pictures from just a few weeks ago, she couldn’t have made these drastic changes in such a short amount of time,” Levine continues. “The work on her jaw and eyes, which seem to be the biggest changes, could not have healed properly in time to snap these new selfies. She looks morphed and distorted. I can’t even see her ears in some of the pictures. Where did her ears go?!”&nbsp;</p><p>Despite all of the buzz, Kim will likely remain unfazed by your opinions. As she told Martinez: “It don’t bother me because I’m beautiful!” she laughed. “I love myself.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6G2rXnKoqSsZZ6axG6ywJycZpldpbmiv9Oimmarpae0prvNZq6eoZedwG61zWaua2hkZYRzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jake-mcgee-net-worth-248533.html><span>←</span><span>Jake McGee Net Worth</span></a>
