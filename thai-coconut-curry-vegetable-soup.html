Let’s be honest, it is nice to get the routine back but man alive, my house is way too quiet. I am pretty sure music is playing almost every minute during the waking hours to make it feel more happening. I loved having all of my kids home under one roof and I miss it already.&nbsp; This whole thing about kids growing up and leaving home is highly overrated. I will take tantrums, diapers, and sleepless nights any day over kids growing up and leaving home!&nbsp;<strong>I love being a Mom</strong>.</p><p>Since it is back to the real world, that means dinnertime. Kids somehow need to eat every single night and they usually go straight to Mom to ask the dreaded question, <strong>“what is for dinner?”</strong> It is my goal to provide nutritious&nbsp;foods that don’t taste as if you eating boring, bland food.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Thai-Coconut-Curry-Vegetable-Soup-3.jpg alt="Thai Coconut Curry Vegetable Soup.

I didn’t want to feel as I was eating “diet food” and feel deprived. So, I experimented with different flavors and fell in love with Thai food.</p><p>This Coconut Curry Soup is made with creamy coconut milk mixed with red curry in a rich peanut sauce. It is rich and creamy with some brightness coming from the fresh lime juice. It is packed with veggies which elevate the nutritional value of this vegetable curry.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Thai-Coconut-Curry-Vegetable-Soup-6.jpg alt="Thai Coconut Curry Vegetable Soup.
