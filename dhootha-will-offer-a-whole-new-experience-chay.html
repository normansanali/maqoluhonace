On the other hand, his 23rd film Thandel will go on floors next month. While the first look of Thandel was released today, the trailer of Dhootha will be launched tomorrow, on the occasion of Naga Chaitanya’s birthday. On the occasion of his birthday, the actor interacted with the media.</p><p>Chaitu says he was waiting to do a web series for a long time. “Of late, the craze for web series is increasing, across the globe. “I love concepts like 24 by Vikram K Kumar. I wanted to do if I get such a story. Then Vikram K. Kumar approached me with a unique concept of Dhootha. Initially, it wasn’t meant to be a web series. But we felt this story can be narrated in depth only in a web series format.”</p><p>He affirms Vikram is a master in making such supernatural thrillers. “Dhootha will give a whole new experience to the audience. Technically, it will be of the next level. We shot it in new locations. The thrills will enthuse you.”</p><p>Chay calls his film Thandel with Chandoo Mondeti is a very special film. “We are doing a lot of groundwork for the movie. Allu Aravind and Bunny Vasu are lending complete support. The entire script is ready. I worked for months on the physical transformation for the character of a fisherman in the movie. I’m practicing Srikakulam slang as well.”</p><p>Naga Chaitanya also says there will be a beautiful and heart-touching love story in Thandel. “It is not a biopic, but we are going to narrate some real-life incidents of a fisherman in a cinematic way.”</p><p>The actor reveals that the regular shoot begins next month and it will continue for 3 months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qMHLrZxnm5%2BifK671aKcp52nqHxzgphpam9nlJ28sMDHmmSwoZyherCyxZ6pZpldrLWwuMRmpZ6vXZrFsbHRopynm5VisKmt2A%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chance-byrd-death-cause-and-obituary-everything-on-the-high-school-football-coach.html><span>←</span><span>Chance Byrd Death Cause And Obituary: Everything On The High School Football Coach</span></a>
