In the legal documents, Tina claimed that their marriage was "insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities." Their divorce was finally official in December 2011. Unfortunately for Matthew, the divorce wasn't his only big split in 2011.</p><p>In March 2011, Beyoncé and Matthew severed their professional relationship after he'd been managing her career the whole time. At the time, the singer told&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, "I've only parted ways with my father on a business level." She went on to explain, "He is my father for life and I love my dad dearly. I am grateful for everything he has taught me. I grew up watching both he and my mother manage and own their own businesses. They were hard-working entrepreneurs and I will continue to follow in their footsteps."</p><p>Nevertheless, the timing was interesting given the scandalous divorce and&nbsp;allegations from Live Nation that Matthew stole money from her 2011 world tour profits. (Matthew denied those claims, according to <a href=#>TMZ</a>.) Ever since Matthew and Tina split up, there's been speculation that Matthew is on the outs with Beyoncé, but he's continually <a href=#>denied</a> a rift.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2tlaIB1e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2Xsrq7zZycrGWglr%2BmutOsZJ2hpqS%2FpLHDaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rome-green-jr.html><span>←</span><span>Rome Green Jr</span></a>
