Their wedding in July of that year was just a month ahead of the arrival of their first child, Egypt Daoud Dean. The couple also welcomed their second son Genesis Ali Dean in December 2014 and the family has remained together ever since.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Swizz Beats shows Alicia Keys support after the Super Bowl</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Swizz Beatz (@therealswizzz)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=711 data-injectable=false>After the show, Swizz Beatz, a steadfast supporter of his wife, tried his best to dispel any rumors about the ongoing Usher-Alicia rumors.
