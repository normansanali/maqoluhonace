Morrison explained that the remark was a line in a promo, but Vince McMahon heard it and envisioned making a lot of money off of the idea.</p><p>Morrison says things were headed in the right direction, but some people in WWE shut it down because they couldn’t have the arena being wet for the remainder of the show.</p><p>“Johnny Drip-Drip was — first of all, I wrote ‘I’m going to moisten someone up with my Drip Stick’ in a promo and it’s [meant as] a joke. Vince hears it and goes, ‘Drip Stick? We’re going to make a fortune on these Drip Sticks!’ He loved it,” Morrison explained, “and I wanted to have my entrance and stand on the turnbuckle and have everyone shoot me with the Drip Sticks. It was going in that direction until people realized that the arena would then be soaking wet with water. [laughs] Then they decided that we can’t sell Drip Sticks. It was so close, that would have put it over the top.”</p><p>WWE went as far as applying to <a href=# rel=noopener>trademark</a> “Drip Stick” for entertainment services in wrestling but didn’t mention merchandising in the original application listing.</p><p>Morrison was then asked about the perception that his own drip cooled off around the time that Seth Rollins started finding his new character. Morrison said that he doesn’t think it was related, and it was more a case of him being off of television and not having a solid plan for his return.</p><p>“I don’t even know if Seth Rollins watches SmackDown or did at the time. As far as the ’drip’ stuff goes, I don’t even know if he knows what ‘drip’ is. The reason it got pulled back on was because Miz left [for <a href=# rel=noopener>Dancing With The Stars</a>]&nbsp;and for some reason I had like three different plans that got changed at the last second,” Morrison explained, “so I was just kinda sitting around. And if you sit around at TV for a couple weeks, then you start to get into trouble, you know what I mean?</p><p>“Because then you haven’t been on TV in two to three months and suddenly it’s like, ‘What do we do with John?’ ‘I don’t know, he hasn’t been on in a while.’ ‘We need someone to put over this guy, how about John?’ And then I think that’s kinda what happened more than Seth Rollins being the cause of it. Although, if there ever was a ‘Drip vs. Drip’ match, I would sign up in a heartbeat because Seth is someone that I never got to wrestle,” he stated. “There’s a number of people I never got to wrestle a singles match with that I would love to wrestle.”</p><p>John Morrison is set to compete as “Johnny Showcase” in on September 3 in Chicago.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who has the best <a href=#>#drip</a>: <a href=#>@TheRealMorrison</a> or <a href=#>@WWERollins</a>? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/z22SjSjbK4</a></p><p>— WWE on FOX (@WWEonFOX) <a href=#>May 3, 2021</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJqbG5rZWK3sLTNZqSoqqKewLC6jJ2poqhdqMGqr8pmnKesopa7pLE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jane-fonda-83-reveals-she-wants-men-to-say-she-looks-good-for-her-age.html><span>←</span><span>Jane Fonda, 83, reveals she wants men 'to say she looks good for her age'</span></a>
