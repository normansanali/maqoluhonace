New information pops up every single day, and it's even becoming a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hot topic for talk show hosts</a>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Mary Kate and Olivier were in a relationship for eight years. While they weren’t pictured together very often, the couple seemed to be happy. Let’s take a look back at Mary-Kate Olsen and Olivier Sarkozy’s relationship timeline.</span></p><h2 id=early-2012---opposites-attract><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><span class=s1>Early 2012 - Opposites Attract</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Whoever coined the phrase “opposites attract” were correct, at least when it comes to Mary-Kate Olsen and Olivier Sarkozy. This unlikely match met at a party in early 2012 and immediately hit it off. Even though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary-Kate made millions as a child television star</a>, she tends to be shy and introverted while Olivier is more outgoing.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=november-2012---first-public-outing><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><span class=s1>November 2012 - First Public Outing</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>The first time the duo were pictured together by paparazzi was in November 2012 at a Knicks game, the first of many Mary-Kate and Olivier would attend together. While they are extremely private and managed to keep their relationship hush-hush for almost six months, neither seemed to care about PDA during the game.</span></p><h2 id=march-2013---olivier-s-first-proposal-is-denied><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><span class=s1>March 2013 - Olivier’s First Proposal Is Denied</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>According to close family and friends, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivier proposed to Mary-Kate</a> a year before she eventually said yes, a fact that was kept under wraps until their official engagement. Olivier was ready to settle down only a year after meeting while Mary-Kate was in no rush and wanted to take her time.</span></p><h2 id=august-2013---the-duo-attend-a-benefit-together><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><span class=s1>August 2013 - The Duo Attend A Benefit Together</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>You might be wondering why it’s such a big deal that this famous couple would attend a benefit together. Well, because Mary-Kate is so shy, she doesn’t normally attend many outside gatherings, thus the big surprise over their attendance. Olivier being there with her helped MK feel more comfortable than she would in those situations.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=february-2014---the-pair-get-engaged><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><span class=s1>February 2014 - The Pair Get Engaged</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Mary-Kate eventually warmed up to the idea of getting married and the child star and businessman officially got engaged in February 2014, about two years after their first meet. Mary-Kate and Olivier are experts at keeping their information private. This is probably why the pair escaped to Jamaica to celebrate their newly engaged status away from prying eyes.</span></p><h2 id=march-2015---mary-kate-shows-off-her-engagement-ring><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><span class=s1>March 2015 - Mary-Kate Shows Off Her Engagement Ring</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>As private as the couple are, it’s hard to keep information secret when Mary-Kate is seen with a huge rock on her ring finger. One of the first pictures of the engaged couple was taken at a book release party in New York City, and then later at a Knicks basketball game, one of their favorite activities.</span></p><h2 id=november-2015---they-officially-tie-the-knot><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><span class=s1>November 2015 - They Officially Tie The Knot</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>The fashion mogul and her fiancé tied the knot in November 2015. Sources say that the ceremony was extremely small with only 50 people, and took place at a residence in New York City. All guests were required to turn in their phones, which is why no pictures surfaced of the newly married couple.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1><span class="s1 related-single">Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Mary-Kate Olsen’s Ironclad Prenup</a></span></p><h2 id=march-2017---mary-kate-gives-an-intimate-interview><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><span class=s1>March 2017 - Mary-Kate Gives An Intimate Interview</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>In March 2017, Mary-Kate and her sister <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">did an exclusive interview</a>, where they opened up about their business and their personal life. For these private celebrities, this interview was a huge deal and they said, “this is the way we chose to move forward in our lives: to not be in the spotlight.”</span></p><h2 id=october-2017---art-party-date-in-new-york><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><span class=s1>October 2017 - Art Party Date In New York</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>The first time Mary-Kate and Olivier were seen at an event in 2017 was at the Take Home A Nude Art Party at Sotheby's in New York. It seems as though the wealthy couple has been happy and content with their newly married status, continuing to maintain their private life.</span></p><h2 id=april-2018---family-outing-with-children><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><span class=s1>April 2018 - Family Outing With Children</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Olivier Sarkozy has two children with his ex-wife, Charlotte Bernard. Mary-Kate gets along well with both of his children and makes an excellent step-mom. Friends have also said that she makes him a better dad. MK is occasionally seen with Olivier and his kids and they always seem to be enjoying themselves.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1><span class="s1 related-single">Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Pics Of Mary-Kate Olsen And Olivier Sarkozy Showing Their 17 Year Age Gap Means Nothing</a></span></p><h2 id=may-2019---last-time-the-duo-are-seen-together-in-public><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><span class=s1>May 2019 - Last Time The Duo Are Seen Together In Public</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>The last time the pair are pictured in public together was in May 2019 at the Longines Global Champions Tour in Spain, about a year before Mary-Kate files for divorce. What they are up to in the next year is anyone’s guess, as Mary-Kate and Olivier keep their personal life a secret.</span></p><h2 id=april-2020-mary-kate-signs-a-petition-for-divorce><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><span class=s1>April 2020: Mary-Kate Signs A Petition For Divorce</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>In April 2020, Mary-Kate signed a petition for divorce from Olivier Sarkozy. Due to the odd times during the coronavirus pandemic, New York courts had stopped receiving any divorce filings except for emergencies. Apparently there weren’t exceptions, even for the rich and famous, because Mary-Kate’s petition was denied.</span></p><p class=p1><span class="s1 related-single">Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary-Kate Olsen Is Divorcing Pierre Olivier Sarkozy...

The big rush has to do with protecting her property in their NYC apartment, which would be safe only if her divorce petition is accepted. It seems as though the eight-year relationship between the fashion mogul and French banker is as good as over.</span></p><p class=p1><span class="s1 next-single">Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Reason Behind The Mary-Kate Olsen- Olivier Sarkozy Divorce</a></span></p><p class=p1>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqpYriiwMRmpqWrlaN6orrDZqaloaaesrN50pqppKeqrsBuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZquipZWhtq%2BxjJ2gr6eimLJurtGemKStoGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-akira-toriyamas-dragon-ball-z-remains-the-quintessential-anime.html><span>←</span><span>Why Akira Toriyamas Dragon Ball Z remains the quintessential anime</span></a>
