As reported by <a href=#>TMZ</a>, Joe took the stage at&nbsp;Governors' Comedy Club, looking visibly inebriated and simply incapable of delivering any punchlines. Fortunately, his wife, Melissa, quickly sprang into action... but not before he hurled a few curse words to the crowd. "I don't know what they gave you backstage, babe, but I got a feeling..." Melissa Gorga said before she led Joe off of the stage. "I swear to you, usually he cracks us up, he has a routine that makes us all laugh in tears every night — that I promise you," she vowed to the audience.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, in a statement to <a href=#>Page Six</a>, Joe revealed that the debacle was due to a combination of alcohol and Sudafed.&nbsp;"This was not a common occurrence for me – I wasn't feeling well and didn't want to let my fans down," he said. "I had been taking Sudafed and had a couple of scotches before I went on stage, as I normally do. Unfortunately my body did not react well to the mix." Perhaps next time Joe should stick to a nice, herbal tea before taking the stage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb29paoZze9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2fvKZ5xqipoJmjYrOitcuem2abn6KypcWMoKCgZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-story-of-us-swimmers-ryan-lochte-jimmy-feigen-gunnar-bentz-at-the-2016-olympics.html><span>←</span><span>The Story of US swimmers Ryan Lochte, Jimmy Feigen, Gunnar Bentz at the 2016 Olympics</span></a>
