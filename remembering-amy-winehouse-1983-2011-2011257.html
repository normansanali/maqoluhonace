However, <a href=#>her untimely death</a> at age 27 in July 2011 from accidental alcohol poisoning meant her time in the spotlight was cut short.</p><p>Since then, musical powerhouses such as <a href=#><strong>Adele</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lady Gaga</strong></a> have paid tribute to the late songstress. “Happy <a href=#>Birthday</a> Amy X,” the “Hello” singer tweeted in September 2016, alongside a photo of the smiling Grammy winner.</p><p>The “When We Were Young” vocalist often expressed her adoration for her fellow Brit. “I love Amy. I always have, I always will,” she told&nbsp;Vice’s&nbsp;i-D&nbsp;magazine in October 2015. “Do you know what makes me supersad? That I’m never going to hear her voice again, other than how I’ve heard it.”</p><p>Gaga was similarly heartbroken upon learning of Winehouse’s death. “It really affected me quite deeply,” the&nbsp;A Star Is Born&nbsp;actress told&nbsp;Rolling Stone&nbsp;in August 2011. “I’m just really glad that we got to admire her and tell her how much we loved her when she was alive. I hope she knows now in Heaven, where she is, how much we all loved her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Oscar winner noted how inspiring Winehouse was to her early on in her career. “I’m a huge fan,” Gaga said. “She was <a href=#>my only hope</a> when I was up and coming. Nobody knew who I was and I had no fans, no record label, and everybody, when they met me, said I wasn’t pretty enough or that my voice was too low or strange. They had nowhere to put me. And then I saw her in Rolling Stone and I saw her live. I just remember thinking, ‘Well, they found somewhere to put Amy.’”</p><p>Scroll to revisit Winehouse’s career and life in photos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkv6a5xKaZnqqZo7RurcyyZLChnpq1sMHSnmRqcWhoenN8kGpka2hhZn92g44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./regigigas-tcg.html><span>←</span><span>Regigigas (TCG) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
