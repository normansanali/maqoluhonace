Despite the terrifying operation and the shattered foot, he still has a wild stage presence, but his commentary is no longer as absurd as it once was.</p><p>Some of the most reflective writing from his career appears near the end of We All Scream. The joke also contains his signature self-deprecation and a sincere sense of thanks.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=patton-oswalt-wife-how-did-she-die></span>Patton Oswalt Wife: How Did She Die?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2016, the death of comedian Oswalt’s wife completely changed his life.</p><p>Nearly a year after Michelle McNamara’s untimely death in her sleep at age 46, Patton Oswalt has disclosed the cause of death.</p><p>In a statement to the Associated Press, the actor and comedian said that the combination of medications in Michelle’s system and disease they were unaware of proved fatal.</p><p>Oswalt said that the pair, who got married in 2005, “had no notion” that she had a disease that resulted in artery blockages.</p><p>She died in April 2016 due to the blockages and her usage of Adderall, Xanax, and fentanyl tranquilizers.</p><p>Oswalt described the final night he spent with his wife in an interview with The New York Times, assuming that she may have unintentionally overdosed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuVobKjvsitsGailaS9or7DsmSdoZRivaLA06ilZqejrK6twIyhmK%2BdXajCs7PEq7BmmpWbvLOxjJqlnWWRm8GmvoypoJyspaeycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brooke-baldwin.html><span>←</span><span>Brooke Baldwin - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Facts, Career</span></a>
