What’s more, she was just 17 years old when her name was put on the list by Vogue Paris.&nbsp;The former Victoria’s Secret Angel has garnered attention for her flawless style, gorgeous runway performances, and powerful presence in the fashion business. Fans and admirers have carefully followed her life throughout the years, which has included milestones like marriage and parenthood. Her weight increase has recently been the buzz of the town. Let’s look at the facts behind Karlie Kloss’ weight increase today, and if it’s connected to her pregnancy and motherhood.</p><h2>Karlie Kloss’s Weight Gain</h2><p>Karlie Kloss was pregnant and had her second child with her husband, Joshua Kushner, a month ago.&nbsp;During her pregnancy, the popular fashion model flaunted her baby belly at various major events, including the Met Gala 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Despite the fact that she just gave birth, the model does not seem to have gained much weight. She was able to maintain her weight even when pregnant.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Karlie-Kloss-1.jpg alt="Karlie Kloss" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Many individuals, however, are looking for the cause behind it. It seems that not all women have major changes in their body composition throughout pregnancy and after delivery.&nbsp;Karlie Kloss is a prime example of this. She demonstrated that each individual’s body responds differently to hormone swings.&nbsp;Furthermore, her fitness might be attributed to her healthy and balanced lifestyle.&nbsp;Kloss, as a fashion model, is very concerned with her workout regimens, nutritional choices, and remaining active.&nbsp;Her devotion to living a healthy lifestyle most certainly had a factor in her beauty.</p><h2>Is Karlie Kloss Pregnant in 2023?</h2><p>Not any longer. Karlie Kloss and her husband had their second child precisely one month ago, on July 11, 2023.&nbsp;Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner had their second child on July 11, 2023.&nbsp;The addition of a new member to their family definitely gave them much pleasure and affection. Pregnancy and delivery are transformational events that often result in physical changes in a woman’s body.&nbsp;While some women gain weight during pregnancy, it’s vital to remember that everyone’s journey is different.</p><h2>Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner’s Relationship Timeline</h2><p><strong>Joshua Kushner and Karlie Kloss</strong> are a power couple. They started dating in 2012 and were married in 2018.&nbsp;They have two children, Levi Joseph and a newborn infant whose name has yet to be announced.&nbsp;Furthermore, Joshua Kushner, Jared Kushner’s younger brother, is a rich tech investor and entrepreneur.&nbsp;Joshua’s brother was a White House aide and is also known as Donald Trump’s son-in-law.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Karlie-Kloss-2.jpg alt="Karlie Kloss" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The former Victoria’s Secret model’s marriage to her spouse is founded on mutual support and profound affection.&nbsp;The married couple periodically shows off their love on social media and at red carpet events.&nbsp;Karlie Kloss has indicated that she followed her heart despite any issues that may have occurred from her relationship with Joshua Kushner, who comes from a different political and religious background.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiimqqcnrJut8uoqqxloKeyqLrAp6tmqqWivLO%2FjLCcop%2BYqXqorcinZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2Wu6V5wqGgpZyimrtusMStmKKko2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-tanner.html><span>←</span><span>James Tanner</span></a>
