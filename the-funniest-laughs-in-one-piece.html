From poster-boy Luffy’s “Shishishishi” chuckle to the hilarious “Yohohoho” chant by Brook, the series is packed with unique laugh styles.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-trafalgar-law-shambles-chuckle data-injectable=false>Trafalgar Law – “Shambles” Chuckle</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqmqqeR0P6c</figure><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=744 data-injectable=true>Trafalgar Law is the enigmatic and cunning pirate captain of the Heart Pirates. He is widely known for his “Shambles” ability which allows him to manipulate objects within a certain designated area. Law has a calm and collected demeanor but his unique laugh often catches both his allies and foes off-guard. His “Chuhahaha” laugh stands in stark contrast to his usual serious disposition and that creates an unexpectedly comedic effect.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Donquixote Doflamingo – “Fuffuffuffuffu” Guffaw</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>Donquixote Doflamingo is a major One Piece villain who sided with the Marines during the Marineford Arc. He is the captain of the Donquixote Pirates and the King of Dressrossa kingdom. Known to be flamboyant and sadistic, the former Warlord of the Sea has a laugh as distinct as his personality. Unsettling and quite eerie, his “Fuffuffuffuffu” guffaw emphasizes his twisted sense of amusement.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Brook – “Yohohoho” Chant</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=719 data-injectable=true>“Soul King” Brook is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of their two swordsmen. The skeletal musician is a character who has experienced a lot of tragedy in his long life and his “Yohohoho” chant reflects his unique perspective on existence. His laugh is unique and memorable as it stands as a reminder of his tragic backstory and Brook’s ability to find joy even in the face of misfortune.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Caesar Clown – “Shurororororo” Wheeze</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>Caesar Clown is the villainous scientist in the Punk Hazard Arc. He is known to be the leading scientist expert on mass-murder weapons. With a laugh as bizarre as his experiments, his “Shurororororo” wheeze is a blend of arrogance and madness which underscores his deranged mindset. His laugh contributes to his portrayal as a mad scientist.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Monkey D. Luffy – “Shishishishi” Chuckle</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>As the protagonist of One Piece, Monkey D. Luffy is known for his carefree and adventurous spirit. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly powerful Straw Hat Pirates. Much like his personality, his “Shishishishishi” laugh is simple and infectious. His laughter captures his playful nature and enthusiasm for life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Nekomamushi – “Goronyanya” Chortle</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=722 data-injectable=true>Nekomamushi, dubbed Ruler of the Night, is the feline guardian of the Whale Forest on Zou. He serves as one of the two retainers for the Kozuki Family of Wano Country. Nekomamushi is known to be a fierce warrior with the appearance of an anthropomorphic lion. His “Goronyanya” laugh is characteristic of his feline nature to purr (Gorogoro) and meow (nya). This adds a cute touch to the fierce fighter’s personality.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Pica – “Pikkya- Pikkya- Pikkyarara” Giggle</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=745 data-injectable=true>One of the top three officers of the Donquixote Pirates, Pica is a mighty fighter who occupies the Spade seat of the Donquixote Family. With a massive stature, and dressed in gold gladiator armor, Pica makes for a very intimidating opponent. The opposite of this is his laugh. Quite unexpected, is the pirate’s high-pitched voice and “pikkya- pikkya- pikkyarara” giggle. This cute laugh does not do well for his scary and aggressive image.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Big Mom – “Ma Ma Ma Ma” Cackle</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>Big Mom remains one of the most iconic villains in anime history, and one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most popular female characters in One Piece</a>. Her “Ma Ma Ma Ma” laugh is simultaneously menacing and hilarious, which sums up the entirety of her character.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Perona – “Horohorohoro” Giggle</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>Perona, also known as Ghost Princess, is the former commander of the Wild Zombies and Surprise Zombies of Thriller Bark before its collapse. Peron has the ability to create and control ghosts. Her haughty attitude and high-pitched “Horohorohoro” giggle play into her princess-like character.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Kaido – “Wororo” Chortle</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=false>“Kaido of the Beasts” is known as the world’s strongest creature. He is the Governor-General of the Beast Pirates and was formerly one of the Four Emperors. Kaido has an overwhelmingly powerful build and menacing appearance. His “Wororo” laugh sounds like a war cry and adds an intimidating, albeit funny effect.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6tn55llqq7r7XErKtmpJGqtKm%2FjKKlZqeemnqxtcScnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sasha-pieterse.html><span>←</span><span>Sasha Pieterse News - Us Weekly</span></a>
