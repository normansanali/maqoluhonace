<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Ben van Beurden Net Worth</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Bernardus Cornelis Adriana Margriet “Ben” van Beurden is a Dutch businessman who is the CEO of Shell plc.&nbsp;He was born on 23 April 1958. Van Beurden joined Shell in 1983, after graduating with a master’s degree in Chemical Engineering from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.</p><p>During his tenure as head of Shell, the company was ordered by a Netherlands court to reduce its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030. Van Beurden described the ruling as “unreasonable” and said the company had no intentions to meet the court-ordered climate targets.</p><p>In early‑2022, ClientEarth began civil proceedings against van&nbsp;Beurden and 12&nbsp;other directors of UK‑based Shell&nbsp;plc in an attempt to hold these individuals personally responsible for failing to adequately prepare the company for a transition to carbon neutrality. More specifically ClientEarth asserts that these individuals have a fiduciary duty under the UK&nbsp;Companies Act to operate in accordance with the 2015 Paris Agreement.</p><h3>Ben van Beurden Net Worth</h3><p>Looking back over 10 years, Ben Van Beurden’s net worth must be over $80 million USD at present times. The available records on the web state that the CEO of Shell had received a pay rise in recent years. Thus, making him among the highest-paid executives in Europe.</p><p>In Shell’s most recent annual reports and accounts, Beurden stated that the company’s income was over $20 billion in 2021. Likewise, the company’s operation’s cash flow rose from $34.1 billion in 2020 to $45.1 billion in 2021. According to Reuters, the Shell CEO sold around 3.9 million pounds of shares in early February 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqVo3q3rc1mmZ6topmyr3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adrian-vazquez-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-670902-html.html><span>←</span><span>Adrian Vazquez Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
