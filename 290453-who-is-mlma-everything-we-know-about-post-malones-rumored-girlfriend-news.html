So, who exactly is Post Malone’s new girl?&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>She doesn't reveal her&nbsp;real name online</strong></h2><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>MLMA, which stands for “Me Love Me A Lot,” is a rapper, designer, and visual artist. Born in Seoul, the young artist declines to disclose any of her personal information online, including her name or age. However,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she has stated</a> that she grew up so poor, she had to make her own barbie dolls out of toilet paper.</span></p><h2><strong>She is an artist&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>With over 1.3 million followers on Instagram, the rapper uses the platform to share her niche artwork where, according to a </span><span>Vogue</span><span> interview, she “uses her face and body as the canvas to present a wildly imaginative, often satirical and feminist body of work that navigates the thin line between what’s gorgeous and what’s gross.” She also seems to&nbsp;have a self-directed original anime series&nbsp;in development. She's gone viral for her unique make-up looks, and she's especially known for starting a trend&nbsp;called the 'wavy brow' in 2018.</span></p><h2><strong>She has a streetwear brand</strong></h2><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>In addition to her body art, the rapper is also the designer of her own streetwear brand called SKOOT popular amongst the skater community. She was previously a designer at the popular streetwear brand MIXXMIX. She left her design job in 2014 to pursue her artistic career.</span></p><h2><strong>She also makes music</strong></h2><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As a musician, her latest single “Deal Me,” which was released last month, has generated nearly 10,000 views. She also released an eerie self-directed music video for her single “you cant kill me im alive” back in May, which has received 170,000 views to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of the new couple?
