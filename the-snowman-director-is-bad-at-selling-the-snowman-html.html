Tomas Alfredson, who previously directed Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Let the Right One In, seems pretty certain that his new crime thriller, which stars Michael Fassbender, isn’t any good. (It’s already opened to <a href=#>poor reviews abroad</a>.) Instead of playing up the fact that the movie touts Martin Scorsese as an executive producer or simply stating that the movie is a good excuse to stare at <a href=#>Mr. Alicia Vikander</a> for two hours, Alfredson has basically just been warning people about his adaptation of the <a href=#>Jo Nesbø novel</a>. “Our shoot time in Norway was way too short.
