According to Frank, any of their blow-ups just came with the territory for their lines of work. "You're both in show business, so you both have a certain ego," the singer said. Frank was also quick to point out that there was no resentment between the siblings. "People perceived I was jealous, but I wasn't."</p><p dir=ltr>Even after the brothers found their respective success in the entertainment industry, they occasionally disagreed with one another. "We still argue over petty stuff," Frank told <a href=#>Closer Weekly</a> in 2017. He compared it to a traditional sibling rivalry. "It's bunk beds to mansions with us!"</p><p dir=ltr>While Frank was not envious of his brother, he struggled to make a name for himself. That was the subject of the documentary "Stallone: Frank, That Is," which looked at Frank's career after his brother became a global star. "And, yeah, everybody thinks that it helps. But it hinders," Frank told Philadelphia in 2019. "There's only room for one person. The other person is thought of as an interloper," he added. In the documentary, Frank rejected the notion that he lived in Sylvester's "shadow." Despite that public perception, Frank held no ill will towards his brother. In fact, he has been very defensive of Sylvester.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtoZYB1go6ssKWulajBpr6MrKuapJyku6Z5x5qqp6xdlrm4rdisZKCnpGKurbvNoGSbqp%2Bptaa%2BjJ%2BpmqabZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sarah-brady-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Sarah Brady Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
