It makes us equal to you. It allows Ryan Neitzel and I to come together and create something beautiful. I have a wonderful fiancé, who challenges me daily to become a better person.”</p><p>“I’m finally healing, and days like today are what helps me continue to grow into the person I’ve been all along, one I’ve locked up for 20-plus years. Today I am loved,” he continued. House also took the opportunity to describe Neitzel, stating, “I have a wonderful fiancé, who challenges me daily to become a better person. To live life authentically. One who I never deserved but blessed to have.
