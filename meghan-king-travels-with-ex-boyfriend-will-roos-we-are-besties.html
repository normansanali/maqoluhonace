Fans quickly started speculating that the two might be dating again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Meghan-King-Travels-to-Texas-With-Ex-Boyfriend-Will-Roos-03.jpg><p>“Are you and will back together?!?! You guys make such a cute couple!!” one person wrote in the comments section.</p><p>King simply responded, “We are besties :).”</p><p>In her Instagram Story, the Gaia Haven Wellness founder said they are “eating our way through Austin,” tagging Texas eateries Ranch 616 and Goldie’s.</p><p>The St. Louis native <a href=#>first went public with Roos</a> in January 2021 amid her split from <a href=#><strong>Jim Edmonds</strong></a>. (King separated from the former MLB player — with whom she shares daughter Aspen, 6, and twins Hayes and Hart, 4 — in October 2019 and their <a href=#>divorce was finalized</a> in April 2021).</p><p>At the time, King called Roos her “friend-turned-boyfriend,” noting that “things happen in a funny way.”</p><p>She gushed over her then-flame, joking via her Instagram Story: “For now, we’re just friends. And by ‘friends’ I mean super close besties who also kiss and hug. Ok, so I don’t mean ‘friends’ at all.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Meghan-King-Travels-to-Texas-With-Ex-Boyfriend-Will-Roos-02.jpg><p>The duo called it quits after a few months. Later that year, King started dating <a href=#><strong>Cuffe Owens</strong></a>. She and <a href=#><strong>President</strong> <strong>Joe Biden</strong></a>‘s nephew tied the knot in October 2021 after three weeks of dating but called it quits the following December after two months of marriage.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ve been through a lot recently, but it all just feels like a quick memory,” King exclusively <a href=#>told Us Weekly</a> in February 2022. “I’m in a really happy place. I think I’ve been through enough trauma that once I do experience something bad, I have a pattern of not dwelling on it.”</p><p>Later that year, the mother of three determined she wanted some privacy after her and Owens’ marriage was <a href=#>annulled</a>. “I told myself I’m done putting people in the public eye, putting people on my Instagram,” she confessed that month during an appearance on the “Two T’s in a Pod” podcast. “I’m done with that.”</p><p>In October 2022, King was <a href=#>open about a romance</a> with a different long-time pal. “Kenny comes over, runs into my arms, and we’re making out. It’s so sweet, it’s like long-lost lovers,” she gushed on an episode of her “Intimate Knowledge” podcast. “It couldn’t have been better. It was such a connection. It was everything I imagined in my brain.” Unfortunately, the fling ended in December.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamnZedrq95yqKloGWkp663scusZLChpJ16psSMm6aynqKesq%2BwjLCgpaRdp7ywv4ywnGaZopp6o7HSraCeq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-opens-up-about-her-eight-hour-testimony-against-paris-robbers-w481890.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian Opens Up About Her Eight-Hour Testimony Against Paris Robbers</span></a>
