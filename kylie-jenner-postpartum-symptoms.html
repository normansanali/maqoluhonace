In March, one month after the birth of her second baby with rapper boyfriend Travis Scott, she shared a set of videos on her Instagram Story and said, "I just want to say to my postpartum moms that postpartum has not been easy. It's not been easy, it's very hard. This experience for me, personally, has been a little harder than with my daughter."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Scott and Jenner are also <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a40008197/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-billboard-music-awards-stormi/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="parents to four-year-old daughter Stormi Webster" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">parents to four-year-old daughter Stormi Webster</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added that social media can be misleading to some moms. "It's not easy mentally, physically, spiritually, it's just crazy," she continued. "I didn't want to just get back to life without saying that, because I think we can look on the Internet, and for other moms going through it right now, we can go on the Internet and it might look a lot easier for other people and, like, put the pressure on us, but it hasn't been easy for me either, it's been hard."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jenner said at the time, "Once I realized that ... I was putting some pressure on myself, and I just keep reminding myself I made a whole human—a beautiful, healthy boy. And we have to stop putting pressure on ourselves to be back—not even physically, just mentally—after birth."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
