John earns a salary of $3 Million per year.</p><p>John made a total of $47 million in compensation alone during the course of his NFL career. During his playing career, he received tens of millions of dollars in additional money via endorsements. However, he has made and lost enormous sums of money in ventures outside of professional athletics.</p><p>But for the bad investments he made, John Elway net worth would definitely have been more than what has been identified as his net worth today.</p><p>One of the most significant was his choice to invest $15 million in a Ponzi scam, which is the same money he could have used to purchase a 10% interest in the Denver Broncos. Before he could get $6 million back to safety, he ended up losing $7 million.</p><p>He made large investments in Laundromax, a fledgling business, in 1998.
