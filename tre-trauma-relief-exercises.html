Our bodies have a natural tendency to suppress discomfort and if we don’t want to remember a painful memory or experience, our mind does a good job at burying it.</p><p id=eeZXnttkuW1 data-wc=19><strong>&nbsp;MORE FROM HATTIE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Desperate for guidance after a breakup, I had a tarot card reading – here's what happened</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eP1o2A83QP9 data-wc=23>This explains why talking therapy can be a lengthy process, and it can often take years to get to the root of trauma.</p><p id=eavEim6jhWv data-wc=63>I absolutely know that there’s no ‘quick fix’ to healing, and (unfortunately), you really do just have to go through the motions.

There was very little verbal communication, but Kelly gently placed my body in position and guided me on where to place my feet and how to position my legs.</p><p id=eCdvO04_Kdgy data-wc=42>I held various positions for as long as they were comfortable. When they weren’t, Kelly would move my legs to a different place. This part of the session lasted for approximately 45minutes and my mind wandered in and out of consciousness throughout.</p><p id=e4T8KPD0LV data-wc=11><strong>&nbsp;READ: <span style=font-family:Montserrat,sans-serif;font-size:15px;background-color:initial;box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:bolder>&nbsp;</span><a class="hm-link hm-link" href=# rel=noopener>The 20-minute ritual that switched off my busy brain instantly</a><span style=font-family:Montserrat,sans-serif;font-size:15px;background-color:initial;box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:bolder>&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p id=eYTBWY4gHkck data-wc=43>During this first session, I was focused on trying to dig up memories in my mind that I wanted to release. It was hard for me to consciously locate them, and I felt frustrated as my mind would then begin to wander again.</p><p id=eGcmFQTGScs0 data-wc=40>Kelly explained at the beginning of the session that there was no right or wrong way to experience TRE. As the session came to a close, I noticed that I hadn’t ‘shaken’ once, or felt the tremors I was anticipating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1ffd4da0a2b2-tre-trauma-release-exercise.jpg><p id=eGXVPUYp1pEC data-wc=52>After some discussion with Kelly, I understood that this was because I was too focused on trying to re-live painful experiences and my body’s adopted coping mechanism of shutting them out was kicking in. My conscious brain would not allow me to relax, so that animal instinct wasn’t able to take over.</p><p id=erj3IecTOJc1 data-wc=27>I booked a second session with Kelly for the following week and arrived feeling more relaxed as I knew what to expect and how the process worked.</p><p id=e2ITPf4aEIqz data-wc=37>We repeated the same steps as before and very quickly I felt my legs start to shake. It’s a very strange, uncontrollable sensation. Your thighs almost vibrate and you feel your body taking control of your mind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/62ed28399edc-hattie-edit-58.jpg><p id=e7P8kLN6hqYT data-wc=37>Knowing that this was the desired outcome made it easier for me to relax. I didn’t put any pressure on myself to think about or focus on anything, and instead just lay quietly and enjoyed the process.</p><p id=e4QFkrUfFb28 data-wc=36>It’s easy to lose track of time as you lie there, and it’s not an unpleasant sensation. My legs were shaking for the entire session, which ended with 10 minutes of lying still at the end.</p><p id=ensgV8s6o2B1 data-wc=12><strong>&nbsp;TRY THIS:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I quit alcohol for three months – here's what happened</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>How did I feel after TRE?</strong></h2><p id=e1r-R8wNZeot data-wc=14>I quickly fell into a deep sleep and woke feeling completely exhausted and drained.</p><p id=eqwyDghWtogj data-wc=21>It’s hard to explain how or why it feels the way it does, but you emerge with a sense of lightness.</p><p id=ekp8VzUAbmUT data-wc=31>My skin looked brighter and I just felt better overall. I felt incredibly safe and supported by Kelly. and see this as a key element to the success of the treatment.</p><h2><strong>Does TRE work?</strong></h2><p id=eyfUs1WhLW5E data-wc=47>Now that I understand how TRE works and how it’s meant to feel, I will absolutely be adding the practice to my roster of well-being and self-care. I have friends who have cured back-aches, released stress, healed from heartbreak and improved their sleep through regular TRE sessions.</p><p id=eJYyRdTVq5XJ data-wc=25>It’s an effective method to deal with the deeply engrained ‘stuff’ without having to go into it, and equally as valuable as a full-body MOT.</p><p id=eXOt7IkJw6Wl data-wc=34>Kelly is available for remote sessions via Zoom and recommends up to four weekly sessions.
