I didn’t actually start to live my life until I left the business, and you don’t want to do that. So, you do make a lot of sacrifices in the business, but you have to stay humble and you have to live that normal life. That’s what I do now.

In the industry, there are people who convince you to be a certain way, but to him, it's important to know who you are and not what others want you to be. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bce4OUYRJUc">said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"There’s a lot of people who are going to try and tell you who you are; try to convince you who you are.
