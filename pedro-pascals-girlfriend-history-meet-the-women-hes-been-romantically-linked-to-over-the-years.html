The accomplished actor rose to fame on Game of Thrones, and now he’s the lead star of two hit television shows: HBO’s&nbsp;The Last Of Us and Disney+’s&nbsp;The Mandalorian. Pedro also made his hosting debut on Saturday Night Live on February 4, 2023. Pedro is so busy with his career that he seemingly puts his love life on the back burner. He brought his sister, <strong>Lux Pascal</strong>, as his date to the 2023 Emmy Awards&nbsp;instead of a romantic partner. Pedro’s never been married, but he has&nbsp;been linked to a few famous actresses that he’s worked with over the years.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>So, who are the women that have allegedly dated Pedro Pascal? We’ve got a complete breakdown on Pedro’s love life below!</p><h2 id=maria-dizzia>Maria Dizzia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pedro-Pascal-Dating-History-EC-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Pedro was linked to&nbsp;Orange Is The New Black&nbsp;star <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Maria Dizzia</strong></a>, 49, back in the 1990s, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a>. The pair never confirmed their relationship. Pedro and Maria later worked together on an episode of&nbsp;Law & Order&nbsp;that aired in 2008. Maria has since gotten married to playwright <strong>Will Eno</strong>, 59, and they have one child together.</p><h2 id=lena-headey>Lena Headey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pedro-Pascal-Dating-History-EC-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Pedro was linked to his&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;co-star <strong>Lena Headey</strong>, 50, in 2014. Pedro played Oberyn Martell and Lena played Cersei Lannister in the hit fantasy series. The pair fueled romance rumors when Lena <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posted a photo</a> of her and Pedro getting cozy with each other in April 2014, which she captioned “Sunshine love.” Later that year, Lena and Pedro was seen shopping at The Grove in LA, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bustle</a>. Neither actor confirmed if their bond was romantic.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In February 2015, Lena <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced she was pregnant</a>, and fans suspected that Pedro could be the father. However, the British actress&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>later confirmed</a> that her then-boyfriend, filmmaker <strong>Dan Cadan</strong>, was her baby’s father. Lena gave birth to her daughter <strong>Teddy</strong> in July 2015. She also has a son <strong>Wylie</strong>, born March 2010, with her first husband, musician <strong>Peter Loughran</strong>. In October 2022, Lena got married to her second husband, actor&nbsp;<strong>Marc Menchaca</strong>, 48.</p><h2 id=robin-tunney>Robin Tunney</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pedro-Pascal-Dating-History-EC-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>In 2015, Pedro was linked to another actress, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Robin Tunney</strong></a>, 51. They had worked together on The Mentalist&nbsp;around that time. Pedro and Robin were <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photographed together</a> while on a stroll in Hollywood in July 2015. Two months later, they <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attended</a> HBO’s 2015 Emmy Awards Afterparty together. The last time Pedro and Robin were seen together was in July 2019, after they enjoyed a dinner date at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles (as seen in the photo above).
