"Happy anniversary baby… Remember our fireworks to this song?" the actress wrote in another post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/46c6fbd588a5-martine-mccutcheon-and-jack-mcmanus-wedding-photo-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eO1aZO71svNc data-wc=8><strong>The couple married on Lake Como in 2012</strong></p><p id=e0b_rg_bNIfu data-wc=78>The 2012 wedding was exclusively covered by <strong>HELLO! </strong>magazine. At the time, Martine said: "We are best friends as well as lovers and totally supportive of one another. We feel that we can conquer anything the world throws at us as long as we have each other, and that's a rare thing. In a world where everything is so disposable, isn't it lovely to do something that has that optimism of, 'Yes, we're going to last the distance.'"</p><p id=eHkbxA2ZpcdB data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>GMB star Kate Garraway welcomes adorable new baby into the family</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/831ad44d23cf-martine-mccutcheon-and-jack-mcmanus-wedding-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ewOf_cOOy5u4 data-wc=8><strong>They celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary on Tuesday</strong></p><p id=evx90zClcIl2 data-wc=61>Jack, who was 28 at the time, added: "To me Martine always looks amazing, but she looks so incredible, I had a tear in my eye pretty much all the way through the ceremony. I am blessed with so many amazing memories and moments with her, but today has topped them all. I feel I'm the luckiest man in the world."</p><p id=eOAtqsI3_JYW data-wc=126>And it seems they are still very much in the honeymoon period, as Martine took to Instagram to share a lengthy post about her soulmate. Posting on her feed, she explained that it hadn't been the most glamorous day, as she'd been struck down with a cold. But Martine added: "As always you are there for me! You make everything better, funnier, lighter and more poignant. We have had a hell of a journey the last 12 years and thru it all, you are one of the few that has never given up on me, never walked away and always made me feel, despite any odds that I should love myself, dare to dream & live the life I want to. I love you for that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b82831451e15-martine-mccutcheon-and-jack-mcmanus-wedding-bridesmaids-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eA4NY4d_-M_D data-wc=7><strong>Martine and her beautiful bridesmaids in blue</strong></p><p id=ePrNWZlEgu4B data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Robbie Williams and wife Ayda throw epic slumber party for birthday girl Teddy</a></strong></p><p id=e_XH7yySKTdh data-wc=75>"Things haven't always been perfect but I guess I got lucky and I got one of the good ones!
