Years prior to the embroilment, Gillie da Kid, real name Nasir Fard, and his Major Figgas clique were heavyweights in Philadelphia’s underground scene for pushing various independent records and mixtapes.</p><p>The seven-person team lastly signed to the Houston, TX-based Suave House Records toward the end of the ’90s, but when the label lost its disbandment with Universal, Gillie went elsewhere to pursue a solo career. The boasting MC crossed paths with Cash Money CEO Bryan “Baby” Williams backstage at a concert in Philadelphia, and nearly within a week, he was signed to the New Orleans label.</p><p>Due to disputes over his publishing, nonetheless, a solo record never occurred; relatively, he remained behind the scenes as a ghostwriter (though Cash Money still denies it). As did significant talents B.G., Juvenile, and Mannie Fresh prior to him, he exited Cash Money, while still remaining on good terms with Lil Wayne — that is, until 2006 when Wayne put out a set of unwarranted jabs against Gillie on one of his mixtapes.</p><p>When Gillie let the cat out of the bag, the hip-hop press (both print and Internet) gave him tons of exposure. Mixtape gurus like DJ Kay Slay and DJ Drama were even seeking the rapper out to give new material. He thereafter inked a deal with rising indie label Babygrande Records, which issued The Best of the GDK Mixtapes compilation in March 2007.</p><p>He released the single “Get Down on the Ground” in 2008, which would be shielded by Soulja Boy in 2013 as just “Get Down.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gillie-da-kid-and-rick-ross></span><span id=Gillie_Da_Kid_and_Rick_Ross>Gillie Da Kid and Rick Ross </span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Da Kid is bringing his stands with Rick Ross to another tier. In his angry diatribe, the rapper-turned-podcaster argued that Rozay owed Meek Mill money because he allegedly locked him in a “1914 slave deal.” On Saturday (July 17), Gillie Da Kid hopped on his Instagram page to air out Rick Ross and his alleged business dealings with his artists. During his three-minute video rant, the rap veteran vet the Maybach Music Group honcho of continuously finding other people’s business but not his own.</p><p>“That’s ya problem, ya always mindin’ niggas business,” Gillie seethed. “You was mindin’ Birdman business some years back when you was running around talking about, ‘Give Khaled the money you owe him!’”</p><p>Gillie afterward claimed that Ross argued Meek money and has him allegedly in a bad record deal. “Well, you give Meek the money you owe him, nigga,” Gillie demanded. “‘Cause, you got him in a 1914 slave deal. A Harriet Tubman joint that he signed when he was 19 and now he’s 35. Why you ain’t renegotiate with a real nigga?”</p><p>“Thank God he’s fuckin’ with them white boys,” Gillie continued. “He’d fuck around, be broke, busted and disgusted fuckin’ with you [Rick Ross]. But he’s a hell of a businessman, though. Salute to you, Meek.”</p><p>During the caption of the video, Gillie wrote, “Leave me Thee fu$k alone…Dis ain’t what u want[.] I represent 4 the youth so I refuse to let old ni$$az play with me…Go feed ur cow.”</p><p>Gillie’s rant was in reply to Ross’ clap back after he dissed the Miami rapper for having cows on his massive property on an episode of Million Dollaz Worth of Game podcast. “It’s old niggas, they don’t hear the roar of the crowd no more, and they still think the world gon’ come back,” Gillie opined. “So, they be on Instagram and they be on social media doing dumb shit. ‘I just bought a cow.’ And all this dumb shit. Fuck would you buy a cow for?”</p><p>In the clip, Ross filmed himself walking around his The Promise Land estate in Fayetteville, Ga. “Fellas, fellas. Let me give you the real game,” he said in the video, seemingly referencing Gillie’s podcast title. “When I spend more money on my cow hooves than you do on your wife and kids every month, you should take notes.”</p><h2 id=h-frequently-asked-questions-about-gillie-da-kid><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-gillie-da-kid></span><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions_About_Gillie_Da_Kid><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions_About_XYZ_H2_and_Centered>Frequently Asked Questions About </span>Gillie Da Kid</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Da Kid?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Da Kid (Nasir Fard) is a popular American rapper and songwriter who comes from Philadelphia.
