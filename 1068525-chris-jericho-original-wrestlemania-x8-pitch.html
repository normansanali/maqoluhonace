During the interview, Jericho says his original idea for the feud was that he and Stephanie would be having an affair instead of being business partners. He went on to explain that the original affair would feature a tease of Rob Van Dam as the ‘other guy’ before Jericho revealed himself as the real culprit, but it ultimately got turned down.</p><p>“My original idea for that angle was, Triple H was hurt and when he came back I was gonna say “Dude, your wife’s having an affair on you” and the affair was with Rob Van Dam. We’d go in the ring and I’d say “we don’t see eye to eye but I can’t stand for this anymore, your wife’s having an affair with Van Dam.” Then, they’d show a video of a guy with a ponytail making out with Stephanie. He’d turn around in the video and it’s me with Rob Van Dam’s hair and then I’m standing behind with a sledgehammer and I fucking kill him right?</p><p>That starts me and Stephanie, we’re together, we’re in love and that’s kind of the whole angle. Triple H wouldn’t go for it, he said: “my character would never be so stupid as to fall for this and my wife would never have an affair on me.” So it ended up being that Stephanie and I were business associates and she was more the focal point than me.</p><p>I remember seeing a WrestleMania graphic for the main event and you see the still shot. It was Triple H versus Chris Jericho with Stephanie McMahon. Instead of Stephanie McMahon being behind me, she was in the front and I was behind her. I remember calling Kevin Dunn and saying “Dude, I’m the champion. I don’t get what’s going on, you gotta change that graphic. It’s like Triple H versus Stephanie with me in the background.” I was just more of a forgotten thing. So the build-up for the match wasn’t great, the positioning of the match wasn’t great, and, in my opinion, the match wasn’t great. But, I can say I was in the main event of WrestleMania, so there ya go.”</p><p>Read More:&nbsp;<a title="Enzo Amore Talks Chris Jericho, Working With Childhood Heroes & Not Being Ricochet In-Ring" href=# rel=noopener>Enzo Amore Talks Chris Jericho, Working With Childhood Heroes & Not Being Ricochet In-Ring</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfY9vb25qZWKwqb7IrGSjnaKesKm7jKipop%2BZo66tedarnKysnJq6orrImmSxcF2ltrWvxw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./are-lodge-dutch-ovens-safe.html><span>←</span><span>Are Lodge Dutch ovens safe?</span></a>
