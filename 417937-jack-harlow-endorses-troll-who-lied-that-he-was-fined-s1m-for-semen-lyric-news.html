He quickly got off-topic, however, delving into a story about how he dated someone from Cincinnati and that was why he liked the Bearcats. All in all, it was an eventful TV appearance.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out Harlow's&nbsp;GameDay performance below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZoR6f5ZmoZqbm2K1or7LqK5mnZ6ZvLO%2FxKxkraqfobluw8eoZKWhlZl6tbTArWShnV2srrR5xaKlnpxdqH6uecWoqWarlaKyr3nLsqmim12jsri%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gloria-pires.html><span>←</span><span>Glria Pires Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
