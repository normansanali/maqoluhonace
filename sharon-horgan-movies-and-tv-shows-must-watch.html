Not only is she an<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;incredible comedy and drama actress</a>, she is also a writer, director and producer. The star’s new BBC drama Best Interests landed on Monday alongside <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Michael Sheen</a>, but what else can you see her in? We’ve put together our favourite Sharon Horgan movies and TV shows…&nbsp;</p><h3 data-gid=eGfPcxFbq11J>Bad Sisters - Apple TV+&nbsp;</h3><p id=eXBDv13DKpE data-wc=65>Our favourite show of 2022 - and co-created by the star - sees <a class=hm-link href=#>Sharon take centre stage as Eva</a>, one of five sisters who decide to take it upon themselves to murder their sister’s diabolical, emotionally abusive husband. With every attempt comes more drama - but believe us when we say you have never rooted for characters to succeed as much as the bad sisters!&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: See the trailer for dark comedy Bad Sisters</figure><h3>Game Night - Amazon Prime Video</h3><p id=eQ2bd3EOgW4 data-wc=58>Game Night is a surprisingly hilarious comedy drama starring the likes of Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams. When a games night goes horribly wrong, a group of friends accidentally find themselves embroiled in a real abduction case. In it, Sharon plays Sarah, an intelligent and funny colleague of Ryan’s who has been brought along on a first date.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/564820053831-sharongamenight.jpg><h3>Catastrophe - Netflix/Channel 4&nbsp;</h3><p id=exixBQ3SN56 data-wc=53>Making her something of a household name was Catastrophe, the Channel 4 comedy starring Sharon alongside Rob Delaney. In it, the pair play a couple of singletons who, after a one-night stand, find out that they are expecting a baby. Chaos ensues. The pitch-perfect show has four seasons, and is an absolute must-watch!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c6b054577004-12080604546703978816140876350212n.jpg><h3>Together - BBC&nbsp;</h3><p id=eiFCYVq4wTiS data-wc=70>In a dramatic turn, Sharon stars opposite James McAvoy in this one-off TV film about a couple on the brink of divorce who are suddenly forced to go into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The television film almost feels like you’re watching a play as the couple speak to the camera and snipe at each other. While very funny, it also comes with a gut punch, so be warned.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7cd058643a3e-1849135637481096125234387120982306940668085n.jpg><h3>Criminal - Netflix</h3><p id=ee8i_sv6Shm0 data-wc=51>Criminal is a fascinating Netflix show with each episode looking at a different interrogation, with viewers attempting to learn just what the person has been accused of - and if they are guilty. Sharon plays an online vigilante whose dodgy intel has catastrophic consequences - and it is a brilliant performance.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f43ac45a5cb3-criminals2verticalsharonrgb-2.jpg><h3>Shining Vale - Lionsgate+&nbsp;</h3><p id=edzUGERMk49e data-wc=47>Starring Courteney Cox and Greg Kinnear, Sharon co-created this drama about a dysfunctional family who move to a small town after a scandal. However, their new home isn’t exactly what they expected as demons are haunting it. This comedy meets horror show is definitely worth checking out!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d686778a5a35-27769114412939016511353594989430882741300014n.jpg><h3 data-gid=eY3sC5JZm6U7>Motherland - BBC/Netflix&nbsp;</h3><p id=eqI8k6-mVo1 data-wc=58>And finally, who doesn’t love Motherland?! The witty comedy about a group of mums at the school gate was once again co-created by Sharon, this time starring Anna Maxwell-Martin as our main, stressed and overworked mum alongside Diane Morgan as her school mum bestie, Liz. The show is still going strong, and we can’t wait for season four!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ed14b9dbdb5e-p05lpx1m.jpg><p id=ey0vtMGEdv data-wc=26></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcG5qZG58tLTAq6anZZikv6itzWakqK6ZmsBurc2dZK2uXai1sMPSZqSuq6RixKLAwqFm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-letter-words-starting-with-r-and-ending-with-l-wordle-game-help.html><span>←</span><span>5 letter words starting with R and ending with L - Wordle Game Help</span></a>
