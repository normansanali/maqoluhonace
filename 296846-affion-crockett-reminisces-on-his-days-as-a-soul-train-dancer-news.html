He learned how to danc<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">e from watching films like&nbsp;Breakin' and&nbsp;Beat Street,</a> as well as keeping himself glued to music videos that came out in the 1980s.

"But by the time I got to L.A., I was already a comedian. I wanted to be on&nbsp;Soul Train because it was TV, it was something to do, it was historic. I ended up getting on there and it was fun!" He approached production and let them know that<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> he was a comedian coming from&nbsp;Def Comedy Jam</a> and had no aspirations of being a professional dancer, so Affion told them he wanted to "be a character."
