Is she married? Who is her husband? What job does she do now? How much is her net worth?</p><p>Get to know all of it here.</p><h3><strong>Meet Alexis LaRue, TikTok’s Tiny Mom</strong></h3><p>TikTok’s “Tiny Mom” Alexis LaRue and her 7-month-old identical twin daughters, Camila Rosalie, and Elena Gabrielle, draw a lot of attention. She was 108 pounds (49 kilograms) before becoming pregnant, but by 38 weeks, she had swollen to 180 pounds (82 kilograms). The twins were born in March 2021 and they weighed 6 pounds 7 ounces and reportedly tripled in size seven months later at 21 lbs each.</p><p>Alexis, who has Camila and Elena with her fiancé, Leo Mejia, shared a TikTok video last month in which she held both daughters with one arm. She had seen it done by an influencer and wanted to attempt it herself. But pulling off the maneuver was more difficult than she had anticipated.</p><p>Alexis is viewed out of breath and giggling in the video, which has over 48 million views. She says the response she has received has been overwhelming.</p><p>“It’s funny because when I posted that video, I didn’t think much of it,” Alexis told Metro back in 2021. “‘I actually didn’t think my babies were that big until I started reading all of the comments.”</p><p>“No one believes they’re mine!” Alexis told TODAY. “I don’t know if I’m just weak, or my babies are just chunky.”</p><p>The Minnesota mom has since uploaded additional gorgeous footage of her babies, and the internet can’t get enough of their adorable expressions. The majority of the remarks are positive, but not all of them.</p><p>“Some people say things like, ‘Oh, they’re gonna be NFL players,’ and ‘together they weigh more than you,’ or ‘stop feeding them so much,’ but I don’t let it get to me,” The Minnesota mom explained. “They’re getting just the right amount of milk. They’re happy and healthy and that’s all that matters. Some people just have big babies!”</p><p>Camila and Elena appear extra large because Alexis is so small. But when her fiance who stands tall at 5’11” the babies don’t appear that chunky.</p><p>In a recent update about her babies, Alexis revealed that her girls were late on every milestone like crawling, walking, and hair growth. She has been struggling with the girls’ speech delays. They have a speech therapist now.</p><h3><strong>Alexis LaRue Husband</strong></h3><p>Alexis LaRue and Leo Mejia likely met each other at their workplace per one <a href=#>FB reel</a>. She made a video about the stigma of dating a co-worker and captioned, “If we never try, how will we know?” while holding her two beautiful babies.</p><p>In March 2023, Alexis posted that she and her soon-to-be husband both forgot that it was their 3-year anniversary. Instead of bashing one another, the couple laughed it off. She captioned, “I guess that’s what happens when you treat every day like your anniversary.”</p><p>But, they are not married just yet and Alexis has a <a href=#>good reason</a> for that. She wants her girls to remember their parents’ wedding day so it will be a while before they exchange wedding vows.</p><p>Alexis was 21 when she found out she was pregnant with fiancé Leo Mejia who is age 23 and was overjoyed. They got engaged not long after.</p><p>Sadly they are no longer together but have agreed on co-parenting their kids. Leo has a separate <a href=#>TikTok</a> where he posts updates about his life and his health progress.</p><h3><strong>Alexis LaRue Age</strong></h3><p>Per Famous Birthdays, Alexis LaRue was born on 17 January 1999.
