There was a certain amount of craft I lacked at the time. But all of us involved in that film worked our arses off and gave it 110 per cent. As <a href=#>Anthony Hopkins</a>' character says: "All men, we reach, we fall, we reach, we fall." That was prophetic because the film reached so far.

I remember feeling embarrassed about this new health buzz that I was getting into bit by bit... I was at home in the garden with a cup of tea and I had nothing to do. Will I go and see a film? No, I'll go and do fucking yoga. For me, walking into a yoga studio was mortifying. It was like walking into a guitar shop or a motor bike shop - instant inferiority complex, when you're not part of the gang. But I took a class and haven't looked back since... You spend so much time in your head in life. And what yoga does is, it asks you to allow your head to be quiet, to allow it to be still, just for an hour and a half. Just deal with your body and your breath. And it's a great workout. I love it.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>5</td><td>[2012, on quitting drinking] When I knocked the jar on the head seven years ago, it was a BIG life change. You know, you don't just not drink and then act the same way and live the same way. For me, the drink was a huge part of my identity and it was a huge part of who I felt I was as a man.

All women have the potential to be sexy and it's nothing to do with the dress someone wears or the make-up they put on their face, it's the aged-old cliché saying: 'What comes from inside'. God, I've met gorgeous women who I'd fancy and give one to, but at the end of the day they're not particularly sexy because they haven't got much going inside and they are too concerned with themselves. And then I've met women who wouldn't be as nearly as attractive and, because of the sense of fun they have and their joi de vivre, as they say, they'd be much sexier and you'd fall for them in a nanosecond."</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>21</td><td>I'm just a true Irish boy at heart.
