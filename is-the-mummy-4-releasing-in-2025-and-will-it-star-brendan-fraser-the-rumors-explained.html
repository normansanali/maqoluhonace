The “Fountain of the Persian Knights.” Ooh, sounds so enticing and very much in line with the first three The Mummy films. But sadly, there are no such plans in place. Neither Universal Pictures nor any of the supposed star cast of the “film” has made any official announcements.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>With Fraser’s revived fame in the background and 2017’s The Mummy (starring Tom Cruise), Universal flaunting every single step of the sequel – if it is ever made – would be a no-brainer, especially if the studio does manage to rope in Weisz whose absence and replacement in the third film contributed to the negative reviews it garnered.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>Disappointing, we know. But what it’s worth, this fake news does put The Mummy 4 back on the map, and with Fraser already <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ready to come back</a> as the bold Rick O’Connell, Universal might finally see the never-ending love fans still have for the franchise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlpJ2ybrnUpqSyZWRiv6a4xJqqoqaXYraveZFpaW5lkaOxbsPIpaNmoaRiwLWt0WaZq52ema6vecWrmKydomLBqbGMq6ymp6KoeqbEz6WYoqaVmXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elden-ring-radagons-soreseal-how-to-get-use.html><span>←</span><span>How to get and use Radagons Soreseal in Elden Ring</span></a>
