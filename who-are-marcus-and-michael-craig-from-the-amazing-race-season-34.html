<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Who Are Marcus And Michael Craig From The Amazing Race Season 34?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Marcus and Michael,</strong> the Amazing Race Season 34 candidates, are military brothers who will now fight against 11 other teams for the title of season champion. Season 34 will premiere on CBS on September 21, 2022, at 10/9c. Season 34 teams will visit France, Spain, Austria, Italy, Iceland, and Jordan. To learn about the next site, teams will be charged with recreating a scene from Best Picture Oscar winner Lawrence of Arabia (1962), learning the Arabic alphabet, and performing a Jordanian traditional dance during the leg in Petra, Jordan. The Amazing Race competition’s starting line will be in Munich, while the finish line will be in Nashville.</p><h2>Marcus and Michael Craig are The Amazing Race Season 34 contestants.</h2><p>Marcus is a tank commander from Richmond Hill, Georgia, and Michael is an Air Force pilot from Alamogordo, New Mexico. Marcus was the one who “introduced” The Amazing Race to his “younger brother.” Marcus finished his primary and secondary schooling at Orrville High School before graduating from Bowie State University in 2015 with a Master of Public Administration (MPA) in Public Policy and Management.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Michael-Craig-1.jpg alt="Michael Craig" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 2007, he began his career as a Jan-Pro Cleaning Systems franchise owner and “co-owned and managed a Commercial Cleaning Franchise in the Greater Cleveland Area.” According to his LinkedIn page, his franchise was recognized as the “top-earning franchise in the Greater Cleveland Area, collecting over $200K in revenue” for the 2007 calendar year.&nbsp;Marcus joined the United States Army as a United States Army Service Member in September 2008, after working there for over a year. He has been in the military for almost 14 years.</p><p>The brothers have now decided to go on The Amazing Race together. They are a force to be reckoned with because they are “intelligent as well as muscular.” The brothers have already devised a plan for dealing with alliances and are looking forward to their new adventure. Marcus says in the promo clip:</p><p>“I’ve been to a number of countries, and so has he. So it’s fantastic that he’s here and that we’re able to accomplish this during our time off from the military. “I’m pumped and ready to go.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Michael-Craig-2.jpg alt="Michael Craig" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Concerning The Amazing Race 2022</h2><p>The new season of The Amazing Race will premiere on CBS on Wednesday. Season 34 will not include non-elimination legs for the first time, despite having an international starting lineup.&nbsp;According to CBS, in the first half of the episode, presenter Phil Keoghan will disclose a “game-changing feature.” This season, Keoghan has even stated that there would be no U-Turns. Keoghan told Parade in a statement:</p><p>“I’m not sure whether it’s been that significant of a content aspect throughout the years.” I mean, a lot of U-Turns have just been ignored. A lot of things aren’t utilized for one reason or another. That was just not the point of returning this time. We had other things on our minds.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#TheAmazingRace</a> If you know me you know I have a little obsession with The Amazing Race.
