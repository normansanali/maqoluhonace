Yes, the famous Big Brother house is fully adorned with Christmas decor from top to bottom — but bedrooms are notably absent. Instead, there are diverse lounge areas for contestants to unwind between competitive events.</p><p>It's important to note that Reindeer Games is pre-recorded, and there are no live feeds. This means the legendary cast wasn't required to be inside the Big Brother house around the clock. Instead, all nine "houseguests" were sequestered in a nearby hotel throughout the filming process.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Big Brother' fans are thoroughly enjoying 'Reindeer Games.'</h2><p>Despite initial criticism, Big Brother Reindeer Games has managed to captivate and entertain the Big Brother fandom, garnering widespread approval.

"Equitable comps?! Amazing strategy?! Genuinely funny DR Sessions? This is what we deserve in regular BB, and I hope the producers see it."</p><p>A second fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, "It's really funny how the Big Brother fanbase (me included) ranged from cautiously optimistic to virulently against Reindeer Games, and it took two days for everyone to fall in love with it and compare the comps more positively to the main show."</p><p>"OK, Big Brother Reindeer Games needs to be a yearly thing," another viewer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. "That first episode was fire. I'm invested.
