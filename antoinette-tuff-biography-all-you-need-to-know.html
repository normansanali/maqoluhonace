She was devastated and desperate.&nbsp;Tuff was the accountant at Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy, Atlanta.&nbsp;She was also working to make ends meet, but in the midst of all these activities, she gave up on life and attempted suicide two days before showing such courage in the face of impending evil.&nbsp;She persuaded a suspected gunman, Michael Brandon Hill, to turn himself in in August 2013. His heroic act not only made her famous, but also gave her a new purpose for living.</span></p><h2><strong><span>All you need to know</span></strong></h2><h4><b><span>Tuff used his experiences to successfully convince a gunman</span></b></h4><p><span>Antoinette Tuff Dress Like Everyday on August 20, 2013, and drove to Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy, the elementary school where she works as an accountant.&nbsp;However, she was severely depressed and never thought her story would be a turning point in another man’s life, and didn’t talk about the one who was on a killing spree.</span></p><p><span>Tuff was working at reception that day.&nbsp;As she settled into her new position, the door opened and a young armed man entered.&nbsp;Michael Brandon Hill, 20, held a long rifle, an AK-47, with one hand on the barrel and the other on the trigger.&nbsp;He had over 500 rounds of ammunition with him and put the school in jail.</span></p><p><span>At that moment, her heart was beating wildly. A strange calm overcame her.&nbsp;While one of the staff alerted the school to the intruder at her command, Antoinette Tuff took her other orders, including alerting the police to her presence and impending mission;&nbsp;shoot and kill and call a news channel.&nbsp;With the dispatcher online, she spoke with her captor.</span></p><p><span>Then the police arrived and a shootout ensued.&nbsp;Somehow she managed to convince him to come back to the office.&nbsp;With a shoulder injury, Hill came home and by that time he got mellow.&nbsp;At this point, Tuff took control of the situation.&nbsp;She told him her story, her vulnerabilities – divorce, suicide attempt and disabled son, while he himself spoke about his history of mental illness;&nbsp;he has bipolar disease.&nbsp;“It’ll be fine, honey,” Tuff said.&nbsp;“I just want you to know that I love you, okay?&nbsp;And I’m proud of you.&nbsp;Hill put down all his weapons and surrendered to the police.</span></p><p><span>That day, Antoinette Tuff looked death in the eye and did not flinch.&nbsp;His character forced a tragedy to end in peace and no one was hurt.&nbsp;She never imagined becoming a hero, saving over 800 lives and wielding the most powerful weapons of all – love and compassion.&nbsp;Hill pleaded guilty to multiple counts and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</span></p><h4><b><span>She became an instant celebrity</span></b></h4><p><span>Tuff’s life changed forever after the incident.&nbsp;The police came to take her statement, and the news stations also interrogated her.&nbsp;The case, in turn, became the only active school shooting situation in the United States that ended without anyone being killed or injured, including the shooter himself.&nbsp;Now the world knows the accountant.</span></p><p><span>Antoinette Tuff became the bestselling author of her 2014 memoir,&nbsp;</span><span>Prepared for a Purpose</span><span>, an inspirational speaker as well as launched mentoring programs in schools.&nbsp;She was also a guest of Michelle Obama during the FLOTUS era during the State of the Union address.&nbsp;Moreover, she inspires people all over the world to overcome their pain.&nbsp;President Barack Obama also called her directly to thank her for her heroism.</span></p><h4><strong><span>His story was made into a film</span></strong></h4><p><span>The 2018 Lifetime film,&nbsp;</span><span>Faith Under Fire</span><span>, a Bishop T.D. Jakes project told the story of Antoinette Tuff.&nbsp;The film starred Toni Braxton as Tuff and other actors including Yaya Dacosta and Malik Yoba.&nbsp;It was nominated for Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th Academy Awards.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiZnqm8qrrEraueZaSqs6d5waKmoKqRpbW6ecClo2axn6p6r7HEnWStp12gu7DDjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angelina-jolie-son-maddox-attend-white-house-state-dinner-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Angelina Jolie, Son Maddox Attend White House State Dinner: Pics</span></a>
