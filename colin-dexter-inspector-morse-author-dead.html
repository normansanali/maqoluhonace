She said: "His loyalty, modesty and self-deprecating humour gave joy to many. His was the sharpest mind and the biggest heart, and his wonderful novels and stories will remain a testament to both."</p><p id=eHoam8lU2GCG data-wc=175>Colin was born Norman Colin Dexter in 1930 in Stamford, Lincolnshire. He studied classics at Cambridge University and became a teacher and then an author of textbooks, before turning his attention to fiction. He won a vast number of awards for his work, and in 2000 received an OBE for his services to literature. The following year he was also awarded the Freedom of Oxford. Upon receiving his OBE, Colin said he liked to think his detective would have bought him a celebratory drink. "I think Morse, if he had existed and was alive, would probably say to me, 'Well, you didn't do too bad a service in your writing.' He might say, 'I wish you'd made me a slightly less miserable blighter and slightly more generous, and you could have painted me in a little bit of a better light.' If he had bought me a drink, a large Glenfiddich or something, that would have been very nice, but knowing him I doubt he would have done - Lewis always bought all the drinks."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
