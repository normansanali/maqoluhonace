According to Richard, she sent tens of thousands of emails as well as hours of voicemails, dozens of tweets and over 100 pages of letters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/30b8215c4987-piers-morgan-baby-reindeer-interview.jpg><p id=eUlGvjx9AA7 data-wc=87>Fiona’s US legal representative Richard Roth spoke to Piers Morgan about the impending lawsuit, explaining why he decided to take the case. He said: “I think there's probably three reasons. Obviously, I'm in the business of making money and I think there's a lot of money to be made here. I think the second reason is that it is really just reprehensible when someone says something's ‘a true story’… And if Netflix is going to say this is a true story, then it better well be true.</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Baby Reindeer: Martha's obsession in numbers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dda5ca7845b0-baby-reindeer-martha.jpg><p id=elj7mED5o1m>Richard Gadd has been vocal about his stalker, named 'Martha' in the show, and just how many messages, voicemails, &nbsp;tweets and emails he received from her before contact was cut off.

And Netflix says, ‘No, no, no, no, we want it to be true’... And they say, ‘We don't want to listen to you. We're making it a true story’. I mean, we're going beyond, this is far worse than negligence. This is intentional misconduct, if they actually were told, ‘Don't make it a true story’ and they said it were true.”</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Real-life Baby Reindeer's 'Martha' sets the record straight on Piers Morgan Show: what she said" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4c6f2c7585b8-richard-gadd-in-blue-shirt.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Real-life Baby Reindeer's 'Martha' sets the record straight on Piers Morgan Show: what she said" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Real-life Baby Reindeer's 'Martha' sets the record straight on Piers Morgan Show: what she said</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer's 'real Martha' Fiona Harvey sues Netflix for £132m" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer's 'real Martha' Fiona Harvey sues Netflix for £132m" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Baby Reindeer's 'real Martha' Fiona Harvey sues Netflix for £132m</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Richard Gadd will testify in £135 million Baby Reindeer lawsuit says Fiona Harvey's lawyer" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Richard Gadd will testify in £135 million Baby Reindeer lawsuit says Fiona Harvey's lawyer" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Richard Gadd will testify in £135 million Baby Reindeer lawsuit says Fiona Harvey's lawyer</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eXylJ_pVuhCw data-wc=60>Speaking to Piers about the emails, Fiona said: “That’s simply not true. If somebody was sending somebody 41,000 emails or something, they’d be doing how many a day? Lots… None of that’s true. I don’t think I sent him anything… No, I think there may have been a couple of emails exchanging, but that was it.
