White and silver balloons lined the stairs, which led to a table with napkins that spelled out Tana’s name in pink and black letters. Elsewhere in the massive home, a pair of “22” silver balloons floated in the air.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>(Video credit: Tana Mongeau/fan page/Instagram)&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Once guests made their way outside, they were greeted with a brunch-style table that was filled with strawberries, grapes, kiwi and more. Glass chalice cups were placed near each plate setting, and a chalkboard sign that read “Happy Birthday Tana” sat at the head of the table. Guests sat on white pillows and blankets. As for the food, Tana kept it simple and extremely relatable. A&nbsp;smorgasbord display table featured tons of chicken sandwiches topped with pickles, slider burgers, shrimp cocktail and more.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The star-studded guest list included: singer <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Noah Cyrus</a> </strong>and internet personalities, <strong>Ashley Schwan, Brittni Grant, Cole Carrigan, Natalie Bohling, Imari Stuart, Amber Mozo, Makoa Ho, Brooke Schofield, Elle Dan Jean, Roman Royale, Kaylyn Slevin, Hunter Moreno</strong>, and more. Guests, which were provided with custom white t-shirts with Tana’s name on them, sipped on Don Julio 1942 <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tequila</a> and partied until the wee hours of the morning. Noah expressed her love for the birthday girl with a massive heart-shaped bouquet of red roses — which set her back around $40,000.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Prior to the celebration, Tana got party-ready with the help of celebrity nail artist, <strong>Jennisse</strong> and hair stylist <strong>Laura Rugetti</strong>. Later on in the night, Tana ended her birthday bash with pizza from Thick ‘n’ Tasty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH13e5FuZq2ZnpZ6rrvNoJyarV2XtrPAx52YsmWglr%2B1xYxraWamn5a1bq%2FYq6ysZaaesaa70manoaekpMBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-fassbender-on-simulating-sex-in-a-dangerous-method-html.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Fassbender on Simulating Sex in Shame and A Dangerous Method</span></a>
