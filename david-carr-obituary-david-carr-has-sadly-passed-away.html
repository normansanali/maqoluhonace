I am writing this note to inform you all about his passing. David Carr, a former athlete who was successful enough to win a world championship, served as the patron of Masters Athletics Western Australia. Carr was also a life member of the organization.<br>David had been experiencing some health concerns since he returned home from his trip to Poland earlier this year, where he had successfully competed in the World Masters Indoor Athletics Championships.</p><p>After being picked for the accolade, David was presented with the WMA Male Athlete of the Year award in 2022, which he received in Torun. David was awarded with this distinction. David competed in races ranging from the 400 meters to the 5000 meters, including the steeplechase, and he won five gold medals at the WMA Championships that were held in Tampere, Finland in 2022. These events included the steeplechase.</p><p>He raced the 5000 meters in a time that was a world record of 29 minutes, 28 seconds, and 57 seconds, and he ran the 2 kilometer Steeple chase in a time that was also a world record of 12 minutes, 26 seconds, and 57 seconds. In 2022, he was successful in shattering six world records in the M 90 category. A true gentleman in every meaning of the word as well as a tremendously important figure in the history of our sport. Our thoughts and prayers are with David’s wife Patricia as well as the rest of David’s family at this difficult time. I pray that he is at peace for all eternity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwsMCvoJ1lk5a%2Fs3nOm6CtrZGnxm6wwK%2BgnWWTlr%2BzeceaqmarkZm5unnPmqqsnZRirrit2Gg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alijan-ibragimovs-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Alijan Ibragimovs Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</span></a>
