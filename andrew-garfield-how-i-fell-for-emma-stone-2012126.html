<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Andrew Garfield: How I Fell for Emma Stone</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>From the minute <strong>Andrew Garfield</strong> met <strong>Emma Stone</strong> during Amazing Spider-Man auditions, he knew they had something special.</p><p>During a recent sit-down with <a href=#>MTV News</a>, Garfield, 28, reveals he felt a connection with his costar — who plays <strong>Peter Parker's</strong> first love, <strong>Gwen Stacy</strong> — almost immediately.</p><p>"We got on really well as people, in between [takes]," the actor shared. "That was the fun stuff: In between, we'd just mess around and I felt, 'Ah, this is different.' I wasn't really aware of what was happening in the screen test. She keeps you on your toes and that wakes you up. That was the beginning."</p><p>Garfield confessed he was thrilled when he learned Stone, 23, had accepted the part.</p><p>"Obviously I was so happy that she got the role and decided to do it," he revealed. "Those are the days I'd look forward to, you know? For [my character] Peter as well, because Peter goes through some horrible stuff in the movie. There's some joy to be had when experiencing his first love."</p><p>As they grew closer during Spider-Man filming, Garfield and Stone eventually decided to take their friendship to the next level. <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> first broke the news last summer that the pair had begun dating.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>At the time, a source revealed to <strong>Us</strong> that the couple was choosing to keep their romance under wraps because both Garfield and Stone had recently gotten out of long-term relationships. (Stone had just split from <strong>Kieran Culkin</strong>, and Garfield from Raising Hope actress <strong>Shannon Woodward</strong>, whom he dated for three years.)</p><p>In September, Stone opened up to Teen Vogue about her appreciation for her man's talents.</p><p>"Andrew is one of the most giving actors I've ever worked with," she told the mag. "If I needed to get to a place of love or sadness in a scene, he'd leave messages on my phone to replay, or slip in lines off camera for a different reaction than what was scripted. He gave me so much to react to."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaappSnsrh5xpqpn6GVobFutM6wZKJllpq5rXnFqKlmnZ2irm6%2F06ilnmViZX5zfZFvZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adam-duritz-net-worth-65187.html><span>←</span><span>Adam Duritz Net Worth</span></a>
