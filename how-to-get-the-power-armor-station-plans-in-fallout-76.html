Appalachia is filled with threats, and the best way to protect yourself is by using Power Armor. Power Armor is one of the best forms of armor in the game. Not only does it protect you from enemies, but it will also keep you safe from radiation and fall damage. If you want to fix up your Power Armor, you will need a Power Armor Station. This guide will show you how to get the Power Armor Station plans in Fallout 76.</p><h2>Fallout 76 Power Armor Station plans location in Fallout 76</h2><p data-injection=true>The Power Armor Station is one of the many workstations you can build in your camp. While other stations&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">like the Brewing Station</a>&nbsp;allow you to craft drinks, the Power Armor Station is specific to Power Armor. Unlike the main workstations you will use, the Power Armor Station plans aren’t just given to you. Instead, you need to track them down if you want to build this useful tool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fallout-76-Mining-Headquarters-Location.jpg><p data-injection=true>There are a few ways to get your hands on the Power Armor Station plans in Fallout 76. The first of them is also the cheapest method; completing a side quest. There is no main quest to complete to get the Power Armor Station plans. Instead, you will need to travel to the southern part of the map, called the Ash Heap, and look for the Garrahan Mining Headquarters. Interacting with the poster out of the building will start the Miner Miracles quest. Completing the quest will reward you with the plans.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to get the Hellcat Power Armor in Fallout 76</a></p><p>If you would rather take the shorter route to get the Power Armor Station plans, you can also purchase them from another player if they happen to be selling them.
