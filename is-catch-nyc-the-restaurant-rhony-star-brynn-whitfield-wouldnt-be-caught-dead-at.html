Housewife <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brynn Whitfield</a> caught flak for bailing on an outing to a restaurant, the name of which was surreptitiously bleeped-out by producers. The censor was perhaps a smart move, given that some of Brynn’s castmates agreed with her declaration that she “wouldn’t be caught dead at [redacted].”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@bravotv</a></p><p>The (redacted) restaurant shade that everyone is talking about 👀 #RHONY<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">♬ Redacted Restaurant from RHONY – Bravo</a></p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>“It’s not 2005, and I’m not a D-list model,” Whitfield quipped. Naturally, Bravo enthusiasts by-way-of X (Twitter) sleuths whipped out their magnifying glasses to guess the eatery in question (you know, Sherlock Holmes-type stuff). So, what restaurant are the castmates of RHONY referring to, and what clues do we have to confirm this?</p><h2 id=h-is-the-redacted-rhony-restaurant-catch data-injectable=false>Is the redacted RHONY restaurant Catch?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>It’s near-impossible for the internet to reach a consensus (remember that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">black and blue dress</a>?), but Bravo fans are largely in agreement that the restaurant Whitfield referenced was Catch, the seafood diner located in NYC’s Meatpacking District. It’s a known tourist trap among Manhattanites, which explains Whitfield’s aversion, and its name is short enough to fit within the one-syllable bleep edited in by producers.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>Another clue that points to Catch comes courtesy of fellow castmate <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessel Taank</a>, who responded to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Whitfield’s recent Instagram</a> post mentioning NYC restaurant guides. “Make sure C**** is on that,” Tank wrote, all-but confirming that the restaurant-that-shall-not-be-named is Catch. But, there’s a catch (sorry), since some viewers have floated a different restaurant that is apparently equally unspeakable and also is a one-syllable C-word (not that one).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by B R Y N N W H I T F I E L D (@brynn_whitfield)</a></p></figure><h2 data-injectable=false>Could the redacted RHONY restaurant be Craft?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>Even Sherlock Holmes would exhaust all leads before wrongfully convicting an innocent restaurant, which is why some Bravo-heads have decided that Craft is the only answer. The reason? Craft was founded by chef Tom Colicchio, who serves as the head judge on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Top Chef</a>, a series which is also a part of the Bravo family. It stands to reason, then, that producers ought to redact negative mentions of Craft since it’s operated by someone on their payroll.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=false>However, the Craft theory (sounds like something Einstein might’ve conceived) loses credibility upon closer inspection, since Catch’s first executive chef, Hung Huynh, was also on Top Chef. No matter what side of the coin you land on, it’s safe to assume that neither restaurant is concerned with all the attention, since even this writer has name-dropped both more times than he’d care to count.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4ycmK2bmGK7uq%2BMrZ%2BeZaKawLWt1KuYp6xdp7Wwuthmqq2ZomKvs8XNp2SwoJmps6qxy51ksKelobGvwIybnGabkaq0qcCMnZyanF2WwXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-did-nisa-vanzant-die-ow-ns-iyanla-fix-my-life-host-iyanla-vanzant-announces-death-of-youngest-daughter.html><span>←</span><span>How did Nisa Vanzant die?
