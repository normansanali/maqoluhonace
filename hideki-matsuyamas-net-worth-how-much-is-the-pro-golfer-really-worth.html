The Japanese golfer is worth $35 million, per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, and already had lucrative sponsorship deals prior to 2021. Experts estimated that Matsuyama made between $8 to $10 million a year on endorsement deals with the likes of Lexus, Srixon and Nomura Securities, per <a href=#>Sportico</a>, but they expected those numbers to skyrocket following his Masters title.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Sports marketing expert Rob Dorfman told Sportico that he expects the golfer to easily triple his endorsement earnings for many years to come. "Barring any career-ending injury or scandal, I'd say a Masters win is easily worth $600 million for Matsuyama," Dorfman said. "He'll be an icon in his golf-mad country." Marketing executive David Schwab echoed those bullish predictions about Matsuyama. "He will have limitless brand deals and corporate requests," the executive told Sportico.</p><p dir=ltr>Lexus bought stock on Matsuyama early by inking him to a sponsorship deal in 2014. "His team has a fleet of four LX SUVs at his disposal in the U.S. and 1 RX crossover in Japan,"&nbsp;per <a href=#>Automotive News</a>. The luxury automobile company struck "marketing reach" gold when Matsuyama wore a shirt with the Lexus logo when he received the green jacket for winning the Masters. Shortly after his groundbreaking victory, Matsuyama signed a three-year partnership deal with IT conglomerate <a href=#>NTT Data</a>, as covered by their website.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWlia4Vze8eim56jmWK6osDSrrCapZGoeq%2Bx02auqKqknXqpu9ZmpK6bmGK2tHnToZxmqKKkeqi7y5%2Bcq2Wimq6tuNhmrqiqpJ18</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harris-faulkner-net-worth-how-rich-is-the-fox-newscaster-actually.html><span>←</span><span>Harris Faulkner Net Worth: How Rich is the Fox Newscaster Actually?</span></a>
