He's received a ton of praise for his performance, but fans still wonder about this.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Dreamworks Pictures</span></figure><p>An oft misinterpreted Stanley Kubrick quote about Steven Spielberg's work highlights a trademark of the filmmaker that defines his best work. The Shining director, when screenwriter Frederic Raphael said that Schindler's List was a good representation of the holocaust, had this to say: "Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. Schindler's List is about 600 who don't."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Saving Private Ryan</a> shares a similarly hopefulness-in-situations-devoid-of-humanity message. A question fans of the films always had though is: Why do <a href=#>Tom Hanks'</a> hands shake throughout the film?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Dreamworks Pictures</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why do Tom Hanks' hands shake in 'Saving Private Ryan'?</h2><p>When we're first introduced to Hanks' character in the film, Captain Miller, we see him working to steady his hands which won't stop shaking. Many have construed this message as a clear message on bravery and heroism being a choice. The casualties on this historically bloody battle at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Normandy</a> were astounding for both Allied and German soldiers: 4,414 confirmed deaths for the former and anywhere from 4,000 to 9,000 for the latter.</p><p>Everyone involved in this particular battle knew that they were up against insurmountable odds, especially Captain Miller with his experience in the military. Miller working to calm his shaking hands and prepping himself to give his life to stop Nazi Germany has been interpreted as him acknowledging his inherent "weakness" and creating the courage needed, through every step of storming the beach and doing his best to protect his men, to complete the mission he accepted.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>The shaking also reveals a flaw that could jeopardize both him and the soldiers under his command. Viewers are left wondering throughout the film if his shaking will become an issue. Whenever there is a pressurized situation, there's an added subconscious tension in scenes involving Captain Miller and the fate of his crew.</p><p>The cause of the shaking could be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post traumatic-stress disorder (PTSD)</a>, something Miller confides in Horvath when he reveals that he shakes, even when there isn't an immediately looming threat. To which Horvath responds: "You may have to get yourself a new line of work. This one doesn’t seem to agree with you anymore."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ukrainian troops in combat.</p><p>Saving Private Ryan opening scene levels of intensity.<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/lypI7ojgKr</a></p>— Thomas C.

Wolfrum (@Wolfrum) <a href=#>December 16, 2020</a></figure><p>It's probably safe to assume that since this is a war movie — and Captain Miller, being of a higher rank has experience in active combat — is suffering from a psychological symptom that wasn't explored much in 1944, when the film takes place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlpKS6brTAp6KsZZiWu6W%2FjKyfmqOVYsCiwsinnmaoop7DosDEZqmymZ4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adolfo-constanzo.html><span>←</span><span>The Drug Kingpin Turned Cult-Leading Serial Killer</span></a>
