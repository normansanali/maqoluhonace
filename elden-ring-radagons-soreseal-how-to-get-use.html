Here's how to find and use it in Elden Ring.</p><p><span>First Published April 25, 2022, 10:38</span></p><p><a href=#>Elden Ring</a> talismans are what the rings were in Dark Souls, and their function similarly. Talismans are a great addition to your character build as they can provide many benefits from boosting stats, gaining buffs and debuffs and many more.</p><p>There are many talismans to be on the lookout for; however, it's worth investing in the <a href=#>legendary talismans</a>, like Radagon's Soreseal. This guide will explore how to find and use this legendary talisman in Elden Ring.</p><h2>How to find Radagon's Soreseal in Elden Ring?</h2><p>Radagon's Soreseal isn't as difficult to locate compared to other legendary talismans; however, it requires you to travel to the hostile yet dangerous Caelid region. This talisman can be found at Fort Faroth, a massive fortification north-east of Selia Hideaway and its adjacent <a href=#>Site of Grace</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/ViOHV62VV4x0iq_0AHbSxLMGrKxhMWSmf9Fus8Qu5mk/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9FbGRlbl9SaW5nLzFhX3dlYXBvbl9nZWFyX2d1aWRlcy9yYWRhZ29uc19zb3Jlc2VhbC9lbGRlbl9yaW5nX3dlYXBvbl9ndWlkZV9yYWRhZ29uc19zb3Jlc2VhbF9tYXBfbG9jYXRpb25feW91dHViZS5wbmc><p>Travel left on the path from the Selia Hideaway Site of Grace until you've reached the fort. There is a Site of Grace found on the premises at the entrance, where you'll need to enter using the staircase alongside it.</p><p>Once inside, head left across the room until you've reached the wooden wall with a ladder. Reach the top of the ladder to find the nearest exit before dropping down into the abandoned area.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/Ih-lWGwG6jJH7wt-phbuX7tU88L5CRL3qKrjEjneiJM/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9FbGRlbl9SaW5nLzFhX3dlYXBvbl9nZWFyX2d1aWRlcy9yYWRhZ29uc19zb3Jlc2VhbC9lbGRlbl9yaW5nX3dlYXBvbl9ndWlkZV9yYWRhZ29uc19zb3Jlc2VhbF9mb3J0X2Zhcm90aF9sYXJnZV9ob2xlX3lvdXR1YmUucG5n><p>Locate a large hole in the floor towards the back section with a ladder to your left, and once inside, you'll need to jump across to a platform where you'll find giant rats guarding a secret area. Defeat these rats and drop down the hole and work your way around the corner to find a corpse where you'll discover Radagon's Soreseal.</p><h2>How to use Radagon's Soreseal in Elden Ring?</h2><p>Radagon's Soreseal will significantly boost your attributes once equipped; however, it also has additional benefits once used. This legendary talisman will grant you five points to your Vigor, Endurance, Strength and Dexterity stats, which may not appear much; however, it can make a difference during the game's early stages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/R2X6NiCLXE4egOnVaREA8wvaUf3zq3rm5E_6eb7lWts/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9FbGRlbl9SaW5nLzFhX3dlYXBvbl9nZWFyX2d1aWRlcy9yYWRhZ29uc19zb3Jlc2VhbC9lbGRlbl9yaW5nX3dlYXBvbl9ndWlkZV9yYWRhZ29uc19zb3Jlc2VhbF9zdGF0X3BhZ2VfeW91dHViZS5wbmc><p>Additionally, this legendary talisman does have a debuff: it will increase all damage inflicted from all types by 15%. This may be a massive debuff; however, the stat boost you'll receive makes it an excellent talisman for low to mid-level characters.</p><p>The boost to your Strength stats can bolster your defences, while the extra Vigor will cancel out any additional damage you may take. It's also worth noting that it can be pretty useful to use the talisman with a weapon you don't have the required stats to wield, which will help you level up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/5svsFwveJILIPM3UoBoJINNHLyE__1daY3eEYcRzkbs/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9FbGRlbl9SaW5nLzFhX3dlYXBvbl9nZWFyX2d1aWRlcy9yYWRhZ29uc19zb3Jlc2VhbC9lbGRlbl9yaW5nX3dlYXBvbl9ndWlkZV9yYWRhZ29uc19zb3Jlc2VhbF90YWxpc21hbl9hY3F1aXNpdGlvbl95b3V0dWJlLnBuZw><p>While we advise not <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">to use it during the late game</a> as the enemies will be much stronger, and the hits you'll take will hurt you more or get you killed in one strike. This talisman is excellent for hybrid, ranged, spellcaster, and Glass Cannon builds but won't help you much in PvP.</p><p>If you're not planning to use Radagon's Soreseal, you can always sell the talisman for 3,000 Runes. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Many players</a> have considered this talisman one of the best items in-game, so it may be worth considering it in your build.</p><p></p><p>We want to thank the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">YouTube channel 100% Guides</a> for the complete tutorial on locating Radagon's Soreseal in Elden Ring.
