We love shopping at Costco any time of year, but if we’re being analytical about it, fall is when they really start dropping all of their biggest hits. Their made-in-house pumpkin pies are one of the first tastes of fall we treat ourselves to each year, and their muffin selection — pumpkin streusel are our favorites — can’t be beat.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Dr. Oz Discusses Giuliana Rancic's Weight: Too Skinny, Needs Muscle</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>
