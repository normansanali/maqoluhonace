<a href=../../../packing-in-advance.html></a>

If you were looking to design an action thriller from the ground up that was virtually guaranteed to secure cult classic status, then there’s a distinct possibility the end product would look an awful lot like Joe Carnahan’s Smokin’ Aces.
Recommended Videos The writer and director concocted a convoluted crime caper that left no stone unturned, roped in an insanely stacked cast of recognizable names, pitted them all against each other in a labyrinthine web of double-crossing, twists, turns, revelations, and nonsensical plot points, and then saw the film greeted with a shrug by critics.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Discover The Personal Life of Lenny Kravitz: His Marriage , Religious Faith and Assess</h2><time>Aug 30, 2024</time>
