She was found dead with apparent gunshot injuries on her face. In a statement issued following the incident, Billhimer said, "Responding Officers made forced entry into the apartment, where they located the deceased body of Ms. Hoffman with an apparent gunshot wound to the face." The dispatchers then discovered the deceased body of Hoffman's dog and also of her ex-husband, Carl Schulz.</p><p>The 52-year-old man was still conscious when the officers found him. He was then shifted to Atlantic City's AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Atlantic City where he was later pronounced dead. "The investigation revealed that Schulz shot Ms. Hoffman, and the dog, before turning the gun on himself," said Billhimer.&nbsp;However, it remains unclear whether the gunman was the father of the victim's two sons.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Om Brahmbhatt: NJ man faces first degree murder charges after gunning down 3 family members in random act of violence</a></p><h2 class=split>GoFundMe set up to raise money for Hoffman's sons</h2><p>A GoFundMe page was set up to raise money for Hoffmans' two sons whose ages have not been revealed.
