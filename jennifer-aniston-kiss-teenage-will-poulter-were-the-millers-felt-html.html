She’s done it many times throughout her career, <a href=#>locking lips with her friend</a> and co-star Adam Sandler three times alone. In what just might be one of her most memorable on-screen smooches, she kissed then-teenager Will Poulter in a scene from 2013’s We’re the Millers. Aniston once revealed how she felt about kissing her young co-star, while Poulter later admitted to being “very sorry” about the whole thing.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-jennifer-aniston-s-kiss-lesson-in-we-re-the-millers>Jennifer Aniston’s kiss lesson in ‘We’re the Millers’</h2><p id=par-2_33>So how did Poulter’s character, Kenny, find himself kissing his fake mom in We’re the Millers? It all started with his pretend sister, Casey, played by Emma Roberts, and a conversation about kissing.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_34>In their “family” RV, while Rose (Aniston) and her “husband” David (Jason Sudeikis) were elsewhere, Kenny admitted to never having kissed a girl. Soon, the two were locking lips, with Casey giving Kenny pointers.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_26>When their “parents” learned what was going on — teaching “how to kiss out of pity” — Rose gave Kenny a kissing lesson of her own.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jennifer Aniston researched whether or not kissing teenage Will was legal before filming</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jennifer-Aniston-who-kissed-Will-Poulter-in-Were-the-Millers-stands-with-him-Emma-Roberts-and-Jason-Sudeikis.jpg><p id=par-5_38>Discussing the We’re the Millers kissing scene on a 2013 talk show appearance, Aniston shared with Conan O’Brien what she did before filming. No, it wasn’t to <a href=#>pop a breath mint</a> or have a conversation with her co-stars.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_36>Although those two things may have happened, the <a href=#>Morning Show</a> star revealed she researched what it would mean legally. “It was just a kiss. That’s not illegal,” Aniston said before saying she “looked way into it.”</p><p id=par-7_22>Aniston was 44 years old when We’re the Millers hit theaters in 2013. Poulter was 19 years old while filming the comedy.</p><p id=par-8_28>Apparently, Aniston felt comfortable enough with the kissing scene because, per director Rawson Thurber, it was her idea for Kenny (Poulter) to kiss Casey (Roberts) and Rose (Aniston).&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_28>“I think it was Jen who thought it would be funny if Rose joined in, which made all the difference in the sequence,” Thurber told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Collider</a> in 2013.&nbsp;</p><h2>Will Poulter said Jennifer Aniston was ‘very supportive’ during their ‘very awkward’ kissing scene&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Will-Poulter-whom-Jennifer-Aniston-kissed-in-Were-the-Millers-stands-with-his-co-star-and-director-Rawson-Thurber.jpg><p id=par-10_35>Through the years, Poulter’s discussed kissing Aniston — and Roberts — in We’re the Millers. While promoting the <a href=#>comedy</a> in 2013, the actor opened up about what it had been like to film the kiss.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_44>“It was kind of a bizarre scene to film, we kind of just laughed our way through it,” he told Collider. “It was a very awkward day for all involved,” he added, providing a description Aniston took one step further, calling it “extremely awkward.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_36>When asked by Roberts if the scene was “that bad,” Poulter replied: “No. Obviously, it’s like boohoo, tiny violin, because obviously, it was the greatest experience of that young boy’s life, which he will remember forever.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_30>In 2022, Poulter reflected on the kissing scene once more, telling <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Independent</a> he felt “very sorry” for Roberts and Aniston before praising the latter for being there for him.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_37>“She was very supportive and took care of me and was aware that, being a 19-year-old kid in that scenario, I was very nervous,” Poulter said. “This was before <a href=#>intimacy coordinators</a>, which I really would have appreciated.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3prrNop2eql2Wu6q%2F06ilZqOZqMBuwMSepZqflWLEqrjLZqeorZypsrN51p6pnmWknbJuucilo56qo2KzprjTZ5%2BtpZxk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./janina-gavankar-net-worth-154143.html><span>←</span><span>Janina Gavankar Net Worth</span></a>
