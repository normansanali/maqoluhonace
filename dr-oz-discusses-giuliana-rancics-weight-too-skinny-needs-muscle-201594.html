<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Dr. Oz Discusses Giuliana Rancic's Weight: Too Skinny, Needs Muscle</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The doctor has spoken.<strong> Dr. Mehmet Oz</strong> spoke to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> on Wednesday, April 8, about <strong><a href=#>Giuliana Rancic</a></strong>'s ongoing controversy regarding her weight and thin body.</p><p>"She's on Tamoxifen because of the cancer and she will be on that for a while," Oz noted to <strong>Us</strong> at The Hollywood Reporter's 35 Most Powerful People in Media event at the Four Seasons. "But it does cause you to lose some weight, plus she has a fast metabolism, plus she has scoliosis. All those things that make her look even thinner than she really is, but there's no question that she's too skinny."</p><p>The medical professional had Rancic on his show for a candid discussion about her thin frame. "Trust me, I don't want to lose weight," she <a href=#>told Dr. Oz on the episode</a>, which also aired on Wednesday. "I don't think it looks attractive."</p><p>Rancic also appeared <a href=#>on the Today show</a> this past week, where she said point-blank that she does not have an eating disorder and her frail appearance was the result of her cancer medication. "I have never had an eating disorder," the E! News host, 40, said. "I wanted to be very clear about that. In fact, I eat a lot. People always love to tweet: 'Eat a burger.' I eat burgers. It's not working."</p><p>Dr. Oz said that eating burgers, however, is not the solution. "The advice is not to eat burgers, because then you'll just get fat," he told <strong>Us</strong>. "But the real advice — I think she's heard, and we talked about it on the show — is that she actually needs to put on some muscle mass."</p><p>The TV personality then gave a detailed list of instructions for an effective fitness regimen in Rancic's case. "This means her workouts can't be on a treadmill," he explained. "She needs to do yoga, Pilates, weights, strength-training. She needs to build up core muscle. That muscle will give you a little bit of a buffer. When you look at people who are really skinny, they are so frail that it risks their health. So she was actually bigger when she was diagnosed and I've done her show and I've talked to her many times. She needs to get back to that and she knows it."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Dr. Oz personally kicks off his day with a super speedy routine. "I actually do a 7-minute workout every morning, 7 minutes!" he told <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p>"It's only 7 minutes on purpose because that's so ridiculously short that you have to be incredibly embarrassed to acknowledge or claim that you don't have 7 minutes in your life. So it's really simple: It's sun salutation yoga. I prefer that to walking, though walking 10 minutes 3 times per week is proven to make an incredible difference in your overall longevity in life. But for the 7-minute workout, I recommend sun salutations or tai chi, something that forces you to stretch yourself, get your heart rate up a little bit so you get a little breathy, but at the same time allow you to build up your strength. So I do sun salutations with pushups and sit ups in between them for 7 minutes."</p><p>According to Oz, mornings are the best time to focus on fitness. "Then you actually do it! I think that's why it's better to do it first thing," he told <strong>Us</strong>, adding that people tend to be tired after a long day. "But if you do it first thing in the morning, you can spend the rest of the day bragging about it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGadql2kx26wyKyarqujmsBus8iuo6KZnpZ6s63NnKCcq12ssqqzx61kraefYsCstc2nsGamlZqxtHnMrqqcpJVif3F9lHJraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./costco-shepherds-pie.html><span>←</span><span>Costco Just Brought Back This Hearty Comfort Food Favorite</span></a>
