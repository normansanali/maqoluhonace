No foul play was expected at the time of discovery.</p><p>The iconic actor starred in the film alongside silver screen legends like Dorothy McGuire, Fess Parker and Kevin Corcoran.</p><p>“Old Yeller” followed the story of a teenage boy who begins to love a stray dog as he helps his family run their Texas home.</p><p>Kirk also lent his talents in Disney classics such as “The Shaggy Dog,” “Swiss Family Robinson” and “The Misadventures of Merlin Jones.”</p><p>He began his career as a child actor and was discovered in 1954 at the age of 13.</p><p>The Kentucky native was reportedly fired from Disney when he was 21 after allegations of homosexuality hit the news in 1964.</p><p>“When I was about 17 or 18 years old, I finally admitted to myself that I wasn’t going to change,” he said during a 1993 interview for Filmfax magazine, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “I didn’t know what the consequences would be, but I had the definite feeling that it was going to wreck my Disney career and maybe my whole acting career. It was all going to come to an end.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Eventually, I became involved with somebody and I was fired,” he continued.</p><p>Kirk was given the honor of being a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney Legend in 2006</a>, but revealed at the time that he was done with movies.</p><p>“Finally, I said to hell with the whole thing, to hell with show business. I’m gonna make a new life for myself, and I got off drugs, completely kicked all that stuff. I went out and started my own business. I’ve done it for years and I live well. I have a nice business, a nice pension, and friends,” he said.</p><p>“I want to be remembered for my Disney work, like&nbsp;‘Swiss Family Robinson’ and&nbsp;‘Old Yeller,’” he continued.</p><p>He also recalled he once saw Walt Disney at a Beverly Hills hotel. “He was with Hedda Hopper, the legendary [gossip] columnist. He put his arm around me, and he said, ‘This is my good-luck piece here,’ to Hedda Hopper. I never forgot that. That’s the nicest compliment he ever gave me.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpKS6rsWMpKCro12kuaV52J6jpZ2iYsC1rdFmnaitnpl6pbHAnWSarF2dtrR5y5qqZq6VnK60eceopJ5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./star-trek-strange-new-worlds.html><span>←</span><span>Strange New Worlds TV Episode Recaps &amp;amp; News</span></a>
