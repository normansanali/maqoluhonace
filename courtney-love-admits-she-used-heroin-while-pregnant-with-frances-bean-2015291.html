<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Courtney Love Admits She Used Heroin While Pregnant With Frances Bean</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>After years of conflicting statements and denials, <strong><a href=#>Courtney Love</a></strong> made a shocking admission in the new documentary Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck. The film about the late Nirvana rocker <strong>Kurt Cobain</strong> screened for the first time at the Sundance Film Festival, and in it, Love is shown making a confession about a past transgression.</p><p>More than 20 years ago, rumor spread that Love, now 50, was using heroin while pregnant with her and then-husband Cobain’s only child. Following an infamous <a href=#>Vanity Fair profile of Love</a>, there was even <a href=#>speculation</a> that their child, daughter <strong>Frances Bean Cobain</strong>, was born addicted to heroin.</p><p>Though she quickly denied the claims at the time, Love admits in Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck that she did, in fact, use heroin at one point while pregnant.</p><p>“I used it once then stopped,” <a href=#>she says in the documentary</a> of her heroin usage during pregnancy. “I knew she would be fine.”</p><p>Frances Bean, now a 22-year-old artist, <a href=#>stood by her mother’s side at the film’s premiere</a> this past weekend, despite their at-times volatile relationship. The brunette stunner was seen hugging and cozying up to Love as they posed for photos on the Sundance red carpet.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Love’s new admission stands in contrast to earlier words from the Hole musician. In 2011, she said in an <a href=#>interview with The Fix</a> that she was still using heroin in the early stages of her pregnancy, when she was not yet aware that she was expecting a child.</p><p>“I used heroin in the first three weeks of my pregnancy — but so f–king what!?” she told the publication. “I didn’t even know I was pregnant at the time! I also took a few puffs on a cigarette when my belly was out to here, but most of those nine months, I walked around with nicotine patches all over my body. When you have a baby inside you, you’re not going to do drugs or something stupid.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In addition to Love’s confession, Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck offers a rare look into Love and Cobain’s private life before the iconic musician’s untimely death in 1994 at the age of 27. Director <strong>Brett Morgen</strong> spoke to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> about the movie and how he got the access that he did.</p><p>“It was kind of like a domino thing, you know what I mean?” the filmmaker told Us. “It was like, first Courtney was involved. Then Frances became involved — Frances Bean is really… that’s why we’re all here. This movie is for her. That’s really what this movie is all about. Once Frances was on board, and Frances and I shared the exact same vision about what this film should be, everybody came on board. I think we all felt, me personally, as well as the others, Dave [Foster] and Krist [Novoselic] and everyone involved with Nirvana, [we] wanted to do this for Frances. And so it is a real honor for us to be here.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacp6Wnwa%2Bx2GajqK6VYq6lucitqmarmJp6tr%2FEnWShnaKktq951qGgpZ1dpb%2Bms82apa1lp57BqXnFq5inm5WoeqOxwKdka2hhan96fY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./braun-strowman-height-weight-age-girlfriend-wife-family-and-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Braun Strowman: Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Wife, Family, and Biography</span></a>
