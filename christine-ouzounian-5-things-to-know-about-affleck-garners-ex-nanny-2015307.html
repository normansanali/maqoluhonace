<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Christine Ouzounian: 5 Things to Know About Affleck, Garner's Ex-Nanny</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Who is she? After<strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong> exclusively broke the news</a> on Wednesday, July 29, that <strong>Ben Affleck</strong> has been dating his kids' former nanny <strong>Christine Ouzounian</strong>, the California native stepped out that same day <a href=#>with a smile</a> on her face.</p><p>As first revealed by <strong>Us,</strong> Affleck and his soon-to-be ex-wife<strong> Jennifer Garner </strong>hired 28-year-old Ouzounian as a nanny for their three kids, <strong>Violet</strong>, 9, <strong>Seraphina</strong>, 6, and<strong> Samuel</strong>, 3. When she came on board to care for the Hollywood scions, the two-time Oscar winner, 42, and his equally famous wife, 43, were in the middle of a secret 10-month trial separation. It was then that the actor and Ouzounian developed an attraction.</p><p>"She says Ben really, really likes her,” an Ouzounian pal tells <strong>Us</strong> in the new issue. "She’s saying this is true love." (A rep for Affleck has meanwhile denied the story, telling Us that “all allegations of a romantic relationship are baseless and untrue.” Ouzounian couldn’t be reached for comment.)</p><p>Below,<strong> Us Weekly </strong>rounds up five facts about Ouzounian.</p><p><strong>1. She Was Born and Bred in Santa Monica, Calif.</strong></p><p>Ouzounian is a California girl at heart. The petite blonde grew up a short distance from the scenic coast of the Pacific Ocean, and attended Santa Monica High School, graduating with the class of 2005. A source tells <strong>Us</strong> that she's of Armenian descent.</p><p><strong>2. She Is an Arizona State University Communications Grad</strong></p><p>Ouzounian went to ASU, where she studied communications with an emphasis on interpersonal relations. During her time in school, she studied abroad in Florence, Italy, and has listed "traveling" as one of her interests. Ouzounian was also a member of the Delta Gamma chapter at ASU, and she's a legacy child: Her mother,<strong> Debra</strong>, attended the same college.</p><p><strong>3. She Was Fired in the Bahamas, Where She Taught and Lived for Two Years</strong></p><p>Shortly before Affleck and Garner <a href=#>announced their split on June 30</a>, they flew to the Bahamas to spend time with their kids away from the storm back home. Who knew it would follow them to the tropical islands? Sources tell <strong>Us</strong> that Garner let Ouzounian go after discovering that there was something going on between the nanny and her estranged husband.</p><p>Before landing her celebrity nannying gig, Ouzounian was a teacher at Head Start Academy, where she worked for two years up until December 2013.</p><p><strong>4. She Used to Be Neil Patrick Harris' Nanny, and a Former Concierge at the Four Seasons</strong></p><p>Ouzounian once looked after <strong>Neil Patrick Harris</strong> and <strong>David Burtka</strong>'s twins, <strong>Gideon Scott</strong> and <strong>Harper Grace</strong>, in New York City for nearly a year and a half. Ouzounian, who started working for Harris in March 2014, wrote on her resume that her duties involved representing "the family well in the public eye and press," as well as being "extremely discreet and flexible." Her role as Harris' nanny involved traveling domestically and internationally, and cooking healthy, organic meals for the kids.</p><p>She has experience in the luxury realm. The West Coast native was a concierge at the plush Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills for nearly a year and a half.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>5. She Has a Twin Sister, Caty, Who Helped Her Get the Nanny Gig</strong></p><p>Ouzounian has a twin sister, <strong>Caty</strong>, who is also a nanny. Her sibling was the one to help her get into the celebrity nannying world. Christine was an employee at a high-end Beverly Hills nanny agency when Affleck and Garner hired her as a nanny for their three kids.</p><p>For more details on how the romance began — and exclusive photos of Affleck and Ouzounian — <a href=#>pick up the latest issue of </a><strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a>,</strong> on stands now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewLW1zZ5kqK2qpMKvtcCnZG5lpJ22r7PSZquoZZujvLh5wJumrqxdlrOnuMScomafkae7pr7SZpyxZZ6Wu6%2FFjGtnam1jZYRw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./caprese-tortellini.html><span>←</span><span>Caprese Tortellini Modern Honey</span></a>
