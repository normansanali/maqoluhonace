But soon in December of that year, Lanisha announced their breakup via Instagram.</span></p><p><span>The model then went on to cherish a private dating life.</span></p><p><span>However, fast forward to 2022, and to everyone’s surprise, Lanisha revealed her pregnancy (but without telling who her baby daddy was). And it wasn’t until a few weeks before the birth of her daughter on September 14, 2022, that Lanisha reveal Nick Cannon was the father.</span></p><p><span>On August 24, Nick also took it to his IG to share some maternity shots with Lanisha.</span></p><p><span>Anyway, now that Lanisha’s daughter Onyx Ice Cole Cannon is here, Nick’s overjoyed. He said, “I vow to protect, provide, guide, and love this child to the best of my abilities.”</span></p><p><span>Likewise, mama Lanisha also shared that she felt blessed to welcome Onyx into this world. “The joy that I feel as a mother is something that has forever opened up my heart in a huge new way. I’m already obsessed with her! And you already know there’ll be no shortage of pics and videos,” she added.</span></p><p><span>But while the parents were delighted, critics online questioned Nick’s untraditional views on monogamy. To which, the rapper responded, “I am not easily triggered and have quite tough skin and have always been an open book but not everyone in my family has that same level of strength.”</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, Nick pleaded with everyone to project all criticism and cynicism toward him and not the “loving and precious mothers of (his) children.”</span></p><p><span>And at the end, Nick also praised Lanisha mentioning that she was the “most guileless, peaceful and non-confrontational kind soul (he) ever witnessed.”</span></p><h3><b>How Many Kids Does Lanisha Cole Have?</b></h3><p><span>Lanisha Cole has only one kid, Onyx Ice Cole Cannon, whom she shares with Nick Cannon.</span></p><p><span>But though this is Lanisha’s first child, it’s baby no. 9 for Nick. And what’s more surprising is that Nick was expecting two more children before 2023! One with&nbsp; Brittany Bell, and another with Abby De La Rosa.</span></p><p><span>Nick’s other eight children are twins Monroe and Moroccan with ex Mariah Carey; son Golden Sagon and daughter Powerful Queen with model Brittany Bell; twin sons Zion and Zillion with former radio personality Abby De La Rosa;&nbsp; son Legendary Love with model Bre Tiesi; and son Zen (who died at 5 months old in December 2021 after being diagnosed with brain cancer) with Alyssa Scott.</span></p><h3><b>Lanisha Cole Husband</b></h3><p><span>Lanisha Cole was married to her ex-husband Rick Licht in December 2014 — after 10 months of their engagement and 6 years of relationship.</span></p><p><span>At the time, the couple’s marriage sparked quite a controversy after Lanisha called out an urban website for allegedly “mocking black women in interracial relationships and marriages while giving rappers and ballers passes all day long.”</span></p><p><span>In her open letter, Lanisha shared that calling someone a “sellout” based on the race of their significant other is “mean-spirited, pathetic and highlights everything wrong with our society.” Also, she confessed that she had never been in a relationship based on wealth or status. “If that was the case then I’m sure you would have seen me out and about with rappers, athletes, artists, etc. I’ve always stayed under the radar (by choice) and made my life decisions based on what I value, what my parents taught me, and what my heart tells me to do,” she explained.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, Lanisha then went on to divorce her ex-husband before 2017.</span></p><p><span>In case you want to know, Rick Licht was the “Chief Executive Officer and Board Member” of </span><i><span>Hero Ventures, LLC</span></i><span> ever since August 2011.
