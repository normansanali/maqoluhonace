She <a href=#>previously got engaged</a> to her former <a href=#>Liv and Maddie</a> costar <a href=#><strong>Ryan McCartan</strong></a> in April 2016 after three years of dating before splitting that October.</p><p>After nearly four years of dating, the “Boyfriend” singer and Doherty <a href=#>announced their split in December 2020</a>. “Hi all. We know there have been some rumors and confusion lately about the status of our relationship and we wanted to set the record straight,” Cameron wrote via her Instagram Story at the time. Noting that the pair <a href=#>had broken up that October</a>, she added: “The decision was incredibly difficult, but we still have love for each other, and will remain friends.”</p><p>According to Cameron’s interview with Teen Vogue, she knew the relationship was “going to end” when it started: “I had the conscious thought, ‘This is going to last for years, and it’s going to devastate me and it’s going to completely tear down everything I thought I knew about myself and I don’t know if I’m going to survive it but I have a choice in this moment. I either dive in and I let this take me by the wrist and drag you behind this huge bus for four years, or I walk away right now.’ I remember thinking, ‘I don’t think that’s much of a choice,’ and <a href=#>I knew I had to dive in</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dove-Cameron-Seemingly-Reveals-What-Went-Wrong-in-Relationship-With-Ex-Thomas-Doherty2.jpg><p>For the next “four years,” Cameron felt like she was “losing sand between my fingers,” as she explained: “I knew time was running out, I knew he couldn’t love me as deeply as I loved him, and I jumped in anyway, and it ended exactly how I thought it was going to end.”</p><p>While Cameron didn’t confirm who the track was penned about, Doherty is the only public relationship she’s been in for four years.</p><p>At the end of the day, the lesson Cameron says she learned was that “no matter how much you love someone, if they can’t possibly love you as deeply, not because they don’t want to, but because they’re not capable, the relationship is bound to fall off the tracks, and sometimes in really ugly ways.”</p><p>“Sand” isn’t the only song Doherty inspired as Cameron told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight</a> in June 2021 that she wrote her single “LazyBaby” not long after their romance ended. “The breakup f—ked me up,” she stated. “It was really hard, and I needed something that was going to get me from where I was, in the mourning process, into the other side.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cameron <a href=#>came out as bisexual</a> that same year and later opened up about celebrating her first <a href=#>Pride Month</a> exclusively with <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. “It’s been interesting because I was always really shy about it and [now] I’ve been getting so many, ‘Happy Pride for you!’ and I’m like, ‘Oh right,’ she told Us. “I’m not an ally. <a href=#>I’m a member part of this</a>, I’m not just an ally. So it’s been, honestly, I would say it feels very vulnerable. It feels very exposed and different, but I’m surfing this new wave and it’s been really special. People have been really, really kind.”</p><p>Alchemical: Volume 1 will be released on Friday, December 1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadp6aaeqStzJ6pqKZdnbavwNJmqqiml2LAorrDZqCsZZGXvLbAjK2fqKWRqHqlu8eeqa2xXai9rbXTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./courtney-love-admits-she-used-heroin-while-pregnant-with-frances-bean-2015291.html><span>←</span><span>Courtney Love Admits She Used Heroin While Pregnant With Frances Bean</span></a>
