Knightley left the franchise behind after Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, which was released in 2011. She did have a cameo role in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, though it left much to be desired.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/orlando-bloom-pirates-of-the-caribbean-900x506.jpeg><p>Orlando Bloom was also freed from the Davy Jones curse, or so it seems, at the end of Dead Men Tell No Tales. We would imagine that if Keira Knightley is involved in a new Pirates series, we might be seeing Bloom also reprise his role as Will Turner. The legal trouble for <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a> is also over, so it could be that all three of the most important legacy characters will be returning for this new <a href=#>series</a>.</p><p>Jerry Bruckheimer is rebooting the franchise, which we have previously reported on. Margot Robbie is meant to lead a new movie, which could also possibly connect to this new Keira Knightley Pirates series. We reported that <a href=#>Bill Nighy</a> was also in talks to return as Davy Jones, so the ending of Dead Men Tell No Tales could connect to this new series and the new Robbie-led movie.</p><p>Johnny Depp did state in court that he would never return to the Pirates franchise, even if he was offered the sum of $300 million. However, the man is the face of the franchise and would imagine that Bruckheimer and Disney have tried to get back into the actor’s good graces. To be honest, we would imagine that the franchise would do so much better with him in it, and Sparrow appearing in the new Keira Knightley Pirates series would be the perfect way to reintegrate Sparrow back into the fold.</p><p>Margot Robbie is likely meant to lead a vicious female band of pirates, and that could mean that Keira Knightley and her Pirates series are going to be connected to that. It would be great to see Swann as some new and seasoned pirate lord. She was essentially a pirate lord in On Stranger Tides, but the pirate life affecting her, even more, would be great to see.</p><p>Jerry Bruckheimer has only <a href=#>announced </a>that he is producing reboot movies, and we are not sure if he has anything to do with this Keira Knightley Pirates series. However, considering that Bruckheimer is the producer of the entire franchise, we would imagine he would have some input to create a world that is interconnected in a much grander way. The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise was always fun, so we are more than excited to see the world expanded on in the form of a new TV series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2idqJi5tr%2FIr5xmo5Wev6J5yqegoKCkobK6ec%2BiqZqslah6tLHRopysZpipuq0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./guy-fieri-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Details on the Celeb Chef</span></a>
