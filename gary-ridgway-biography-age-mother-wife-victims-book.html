This made him the most prolific serial killer in United States history according to confirmed murders.</p><p>Gary killed myriad teenage girls and women in the state of Washington during the 1980s and 1990s and is now thought to have killed more than 90.&nbsp;Most of his victims were alleged to be sex workers and other women in vulnerable circumstances, including underage runaways. He was given the nickname Green River Killer, after the first five victims were found in the Green River before his identity was known.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gary-ridgway-age></span><span>Gary Ridgway Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gary is 70 years old as of 2019. He was born on February 18, 1949.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gary-ridgway-mother></span><span>Gary Ridgway Mother</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gary’s mother is Mary Ridgway. Relatives described Gary’s mother as domineering and have said that young Ridgway witnessed more than one violent argument between his parents. Gary told defense psychologists that, as an adolescent, he had conflicting feelings of anger and sexual attraction toward his mother, and fantasized about killing her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=green-river-killer-wife></span><span>Green River Killer Wife</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gary had been married three times. He was first married to Claudia Kraig Barrows in 1970 but they divorced in 1972. Later in 1973, he married Marcia Lorene Brown but also divorced in 1981. His last marriage was with Judith Lorraine Lynch, which lasted from 1988 to 2002.</p><p>Gary’s first two marriages failed because of infidelities by both partners. His second wife Marcia Lorene Brown claimed that he had placed her in a chokehold and that he had become religious, proselytizing door-to-door, reading the Bible aloud at work and at home, and insisting that his wife follow the strict teachings of their pastor. Despite his beliefs, Gary still wanted his wife to participate in sex in public and inappropriate places, sometimes even in areas where his victims’ bodies were later discovered.</p><p>All three of his ex-wives and several girlfriends reported that he demanded sex from them several times a day and would often want to have sex in a public area or in the woods.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=green-river-killings></span><span>Green River Killings</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the 1980s and 1990s, Gary is believed to have murdered at least 71 teenage girls and women near Seattle and Tacoma, Washington. Later, in court statements, Gary reported that he had killed so many that he lost count. Most of the murders occurred between 1982 and 1984. His victims were believed to be either sex workers or runaways picked up along Pacific Highway South, whom he strangled and dumped most of the bodies in wooded areas around the Green River, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and other “dump sites” within South King County. The bodies were often left in clusters, sometimes posed, usually nude and Gary would sometimes return to the victims’ bodies and have sexual intercourse with them.</p><p>Gary would later explain that he did not find necrophilia more sexually satisfying, but having sex with the deceased reduced his need to obtain a living victim and thus limited his exposure to being caught. Three of the victims are still unidentified because most of the bodies were not discovered until only the skeletons remained. Gary often contaminated the dump sites with gum, cigarettes, and written materials belonging to others, and he even transported a few victims’ remains across state lines into Oregon to confuse the police.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gary-ridgway-victims></span><span>Gary Ridgway Victims</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody><tr><td width=189>Name</td><td width=115>Age</td><td width=127>Disappeared</td><td width=117>Found</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>1</td><td>Wendy Lee Coffield</td><td align=right>16</td><td align=right>8-Jul-82</td><td align=right>15-Jul-82</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>2</td><td>Gisele Ann Lovvorn</td><td align=right>17</td><td align=right>17-Jul-82</td><td align=right>25-Sep-82</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>3</td><td>Debra Lynn Bonner</td><td align=right>23</td><td align=right>25-Jul-82</td><td align=right>12-Aug-82</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>4</td><td>Marcia Fay Chapman</td><td align=right>31</td><td align=right>1-Aug-82</td><td align=right>15-Aug-82</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>5</td><td>Cynthia Jean Hinds</td><td align=right>17</td><td align=right>11-Aug-82</td><td align=right>15-Aug-82</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>6</td><td>Opal Charmaine Mills</td><td align=right>16</td><td align=right>12-Aug-82</td><td align=right>15-Aug-82</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>7</td><td>Terry Rene Milligan</td><td align=right>16</td><td align=right>29-Aug-82</td><td align=right>1-Apr-84</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>8</td><td>Mary Bridget Meehan</td><td align=right>18</td><td align=right>15-Sep-82</td><td align=right>13-Nov-83</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>9</td><td>Debra Lorraine Estes</td><td align=right>15</td><td align=right>20-Sep-82</td><td align=right>30-May-88</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>10</td><td>Linda Jane Rule</td><td align=right>16</td><td align=right>26-Sep-82</td><td align=right>31-Jan-83</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>11</td><td>Denise Darcel Bush</td><td align=right>23</td><td align=right>8-Oct-82</td><td align=right>12-Jun-85</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>12</td><td>Shawnda Leea Summers</td><td align=right>16</td><td align=right>9-Oct-82</td><td align=right>11-Aug-83</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>13</td><td>Shirley Marie Sherrill</td><td align=right>18</td><td>October 20–22, 1982</td><td align=right>14-Jun-85</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>14</td><td>Rebecca “Becky” Marrero</td><td align=right>20</td><td align=right>3-Dec-82</td><td align=right>21-Dec-10</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>15</td><td>Colleen Renee Brockman</td><td align=right>15</td><td align=right>24-Dec-82</td><td align=right>26-May-84</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>16</td><td>Sandra Denise Major</td><td align=right>20</td><td align=right>24-Dec-82</td><td align=right>30-Dec-85</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>17</td><td>Alma Ann Smith</td><td align=right>18</td><td align=right>3-Mar-83</td><td align=right>2-Apr-84</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>18</td><td>Delores LaVerne Williams</td><td align=right>17</td><td>March 8–14, 1983</td><td align=right>31-Mar-84</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>19</td><td>Gail Lynn Mathews</td><td align=right>23</td><td align=right>10-Apr-83</td><td align=right>18-Sep-83</td></tr><tr><td align=right height=20>20</td><td>Andrea M.
