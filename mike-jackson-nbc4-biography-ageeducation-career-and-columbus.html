As a community, African Americans have higher rates of all three risk factors than the general population.“I can’t wait to be there on Saturday and I like educating other people about it – ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health,” Jackson said.</p><p>Jackson has been a strong supporter of the walk for years. In the wake of his stroke, he is having to re-learn how to walk and says he’s learning how to rely on the support of others. “All of us love and depend on others and as much as sometimes we try to separate ourselves from the noise and the crowd – there’s very little any of us can achieve without the help and love of other people,” he said.NBC4 is proud to partner with the 2019 African American Male Wellness Walk.</p><p>The walk has been a wake-up call for so many men across central Ohio.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1forassYyjmJyjo6S7brrBnGtmmpmktLOtz6GwZpmXmrKlwcKaq6KnnmKwor7EnqlmmZ6ZeqS7y66km62jZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kathleen-eyring-obituary-and-death-cause.html><span>←</span><span>Kathleen Eyring Obituary And Death Cause, President Henry Wife Died At 82</span></a>
