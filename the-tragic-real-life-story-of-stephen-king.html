According to Lisa Rogak's 2009 biography, <a href=#>Haunted Heart: The Life and Times of Stephen King</a>, baby Stephen's birth came as a surprise. Years earlier, Ruth King was diagnosed as infertile, which had led the Kings to adopt Stephen's older brother, David Victor, in 1945.</p><p>In the early years of their marriage, Ruth and Donald King were constantly on the move.

Lovecraft</a>, would prove a revelatory moment for King.</p><p>With the end of the <a href=#>World War II</a>, Donald King returned home on a more or less permanent basis and took a job as a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman. Although Stephen King has virtually no memories of his father, he has described him as "a man with an itchy foot."
