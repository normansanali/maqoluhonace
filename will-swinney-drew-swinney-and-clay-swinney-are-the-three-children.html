The Tigers began the year rated #9 in the preseason polls, but they proceeded to go 3–3 (1–2 ACC) in their first six games after starting the year in that spot. When the news of his promotion came to him, he was in the middle of preparing the wide receivers for the upcoming game when he heard it.<br>Swinney was selected as the new head coach of the Clemson Tigers over Clemson’s defensive coordinator Vic Koenning, who was formerly the head coach of Wyoming, and associate head coach Brad Scott. Swinney is known for being an excellent recruiter (former head coach of South Carolina). Swinney’s first actions as interim head coach were to fire offensive coordinator Rob Spence and to introduce a new tradition called the “Tiger Walk.” During the “Tiger Walk,” all of the players and coaches walk through the parking lot outside Memorial Stadium about two hours before a game as they head inside to finish preparing for the game. Swinney’s first actions as interim head coach were to fire Spence and to introduce the new tradition. On October 18, his first game as interim Head Coach, the team’s performance against Georgia Tech resulted in a loss by a score of 21–17. Swinney won his first game as head coach of the Tigers on November 1, 2008, when Clemson broke a six-game losing streak over Boston College with a victory against the Eagles. This victory was Swinney’s first of many. The annual rivalry game between Clemson and South Carolina was played on November 29, 2008, when Swinney led Clemson to a victory against South Carolina by a score of 31–14. Following this victory, Clemson qualified for a bowl game. Swinney was formally appointed as Clemson’s 27th head coach on December 1, 2008, shortly after receiving a vote of confidence from Clemson’s athletic director, Terry Don Phillips. The 2009 Gator Bowl was his first game as the full-time head coach of the team, and they were defeated by the Nebraska Cornhuskers by a score of 26–21.</p><p style=text-align:justify>When Swinney produced five consecutive recruiting classes that ranked in the top 20 on ESPN’s list, including top 10 classes in 2011 and 2012, his reputation as a successful recruiter became clear. As a consequence of this, Clemson was one of only 10 schools to be ranked in the top 20 of recruiting for five years in a row (along with LSU, Alabama, Texas, USC, Florida, Georgia, Florida State, Ohio State, and Oklahoma), and as of 2014, Swinney was one of only four active head coaches at the time to accomplish the feat. In addition, Clemson was one of only 10 schools to be ranked in the top 20 of recruiting for five years in (along with Nick Saban, Les Miles, and Bob Stoops).</p><p style=text-align:justify>Swinney was hired by Clemson, despite the fact that some Clemson fans did not approve of his reputation as a recruiter. Some spectators and commentators pointed out that he had never held a role other than that of a coach. Others were dubious about Clemson’s decision to keep aboard one of Bowden’s assistants as a member of the coaching staff.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrHDmpummpqisG%2B1zWiuoqScYsC4tc2nnLJllKeyuHnSsKCnppWueqK6w2aapZmpYsC4tc2nnLJlkaeybsDHnmStoKKasm6vx6KjnaqVo3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./was-ashitaka-from-princess-mononoke-engaged-before-meeting-san.html><span>←</span><span>Was Ashitaka from Princess Mononoke engaged before meeting San?</span></a>
