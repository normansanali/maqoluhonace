The Shop With Us team aims to highlight products and services our readers might find interesting and useful, such as <a href=#>wedding-guest outfits</a>, <a href=#>purses</a>, <a href=#>plus-size swimsuits</a>, <a href=#>women's sneakers</a>, <a href=#>bridal shapewear</a>, and <a href=#>perfect gift ideas</a> for everyone in your life. Product and service selection, however, is in no way intended to constitute an endorsement by either Us Weekly or of any celebrity mentioned in the post.</p><p>The Shop With Us team may receive products free of charge from manufacturers to test. In addition, Us Weekly receives compensation from the manufacturer of the products we write about when you click on a link and then purchase the product featured in an article. This does not drive our decision as to whether or not a product or service is featured or recommended. Shop With Us operates independently from the advertising sales team. We welcome your feedback at <a href=#>ShopWithUs@usmagazine.com</a>. Happy shopping!</p><p>We’ve been making a lot of changes in our <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">wardrobe</a> lately. We’re being pickier than we used to be. Instead of just being like, “Oh, that’s cute and the price is right” and placing the order, we’re putting more thought into it. How will this piece fit into our wardrobe? How many ways can we wear it? What is the fabric made of? What do reviewers think?</p><p>While “picky” is often seen as a negative word, when you’re too lax with your shopping rules, you end up with a closet full of pieces you never actually wear — and when you do wear them, they tend to fall apart fast. That’s assuming you can even find them buried behind everything else. That’s why for <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">this sweater dress</a>, we made sure to look through over 50 other options before deciding that it definitely doesn’t get any better than this!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pink-queen-sweater-dress-orange.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Pink Queen Loose Oversize Turtleneck Sweater Dress</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$33</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, October 2, 2020, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">This sweater dress</a> has so many stellar reviews, and the fact that there are currently 13 colors to choose from doesn’t hurt. That includes a few patterns — animal print and tie-dye lovers, rejoice! As for the material, it’s super soft — not itchy — thick and way, way cozy. The oversize turtle neckline adds to this coziness even more (and looks super chic)!</p><p>One unexpected thing about this sweater dress? It has pockets! It’s not common to find pockets in pullover sweater pieces, but they work perfectly here, and we’d never turn down pockets anyway!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pink-queen-sweater-dress-grey.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Pink Queen Loose Oversize Turtleneck Sweater Dress</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$33</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, October 2, 2020, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>While this is a dress, it’s on the shorter side, and because of the overall look of the piece, it can definitely be worn as a tunic as well. Throw it on over jeans for a super comfy, casual look, or over leggings to dive even deeper into the comfy part. And when it comes time to lose the bottoms and wear it as a dress, get creative! You can stick with <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> or loafers, or you can use all of that leg room to your advantage with tall boots or strappy heels!</p><p>This is a wonderful time of year to grab <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">this dress</a>. You can wear it on its own right now, and then simply start to layer up when the temperature drops down over the winter. So cute either way!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Pink Queen Loose Oversize Turtleneck Sweater Dress</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$33</a> at Amazon!
