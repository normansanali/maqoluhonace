After releasing the warm-up track “<a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Red Ruby (Da Sleeze)</a>” earlier this year, the New York artist officially released what she’s dubbed her “greatest song yet” on Friday (September 1) —&nbsp;<a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>“Last Time That I Saw You.”</a></p><p>In a conversation with Apple Music 1’s Zane Lowe about the song, Nicki Minaj revealed that she didn’t plan on releasing it as a single at first.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/09/nicki-minaj-cements-queen-sleeze-alter-ego-with-weight-new-iced-out-chain-250x142.jpg alt="Nicki Minaj Cements ‘Queen Sleeze’ Alter Ego With Weighty New Iced-Out Chain" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Nicki Minaj Cements ‘Queen Sleeze’ Alter Ego With Weighty New Iced-Out Chain</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>September 3, 2023</p></a><p>“I knew for the album, of course, I would have to discuss certain things or whatever,” she said. “I just didn’t intend on it being a single. A lot of times people forget that I do a lot of features, and so these are not my actual songs.</p><p>“These are not songs from my album. And so sometimes people forget the kind of music that I’m able to create because it’s been a long time since they heard an album, and most of the times they get those kind of cuts on the album.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>She continued: “This time when I heard the beat, the first thing I did was I wrote the hook. And when I wrote the hook, to me, it felt it was… The vibe of it was really talking about a loss, a real loss you know. But to not make the song feel only directed at one kind of loss. When I wrote the singing verse, I tried to expand it and think even about relationships.</p><p>“And then by the time I got to the rap, it was like I had included all relationships that I had lost before, because I mentioned even best friends and stuff like that. I just wanted the next song that I put out, Zane, to represent my growth, but not just as an artist, but as a human being. I’ve experienced so many things that I hadn’t experienced five years ago, and that’s just the truth.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0milopubnnqutc2aoWaomaO4brLRopuasV1neqK4056pp5mkmnqku9WeqQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./megan-gaither-video-viral-teacher-suspended.html><span>←</span><span>Megan Gaither Video Viral: Teacher Suspended For OnlyFans Account</span></a>
