Duck Dynasty‘s <strong>Sadie Robertson</strong> had never danced outside of her bedroom prior to joining season 19 of Dancing With the Stars, but somehow, she and partner <strong>Mark Ballas</strong> have made it to the final five in the race for the Mirrorball. A lot of people are rooting for the A&E reality star to take it all — but no one is prouder of her success than her parents, <strong>Willie</strong> and <strong>Korie Robertson</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>“I definitely got overwhelmed there,” dad Willie says in the exclusive video above, of watching 17-year-old Sadie take the floor for the first time. “There was a tear or two.”</p><p>That she’s even in the competition is something of a surprise to mom Korie, who wasn’t totally sold on the idea initially. “When Sadie first asked me if she could do Dancing With the Stars, I was a little bit unsure, because, you know, it’s a little scary putting your daughter out there,” she admits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Not wanting to be the one to dash her little girl’s spirits, Korie handed the reins to her husband. “I actually thought Willie would say no, so I told Sadie to ask her daddy. But Willie said, ‘Well, you know, you’re 17 years old, if that’s something you want to do, go for it,'” Korie recalls. “I mean, my jaw dropped.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>These days, the jaws dropping belong to the DWTS judges, who’ve repeatedly praised Sadie’s performances. During the quarterfinals on Nov. 10, she and Ballas earned a perfect score — 40 out of 40 — for their Foxtrot with <strong>Emma Slater</strong> to “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You.” Veteran head judge <strong>Len Goodman</strong> called it the “best trio of the night” and said he wished he could’ve given them higher than a 10.</p><p>Watch the video above to see Willie and Korie talk about Sadie’s DWTS run — and to see what Uncle Si thinks of the whole thing!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqanJmaerO7wZ6praufo8BuvMCrnKeso2K%2FprLLnpqtZZ%2Bjeqmx0Wasp6SZoLKtxYydrq2rXafCr3mRaWhtaWdmfnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-simmons-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Nick Simmons Net Worth</span></a>
