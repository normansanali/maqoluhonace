The research team is working cautiously to ensure that it remains that way.</p><p>As they prepare to excavate the tusk in its entirety, the research team has been working to strengthen it with situ, using polymers and plaster similar to how broken bones are treated in hospitals.</p><p>“The more complete we get it out, the better it can be conserved,” said Ianir Milevski, the Israel Antiquities Authority’s (IAA) head of prehistory.</p><p>And while this only marks the second instance of an ancient tusk being found, archaeologists working at the open-air site have frequently found other elephant remains there —&nbsp;as well as evidence of hominin populations occupying the area.</p><p>In particular, researchers have unearthed ancient Paleolithic weaponry such as large hand-axes that would have been used to hunt massive animals like ancient elephants. Many researchers believe these early human populations did indeed hunt these ancient beasts, as one elephant could provide ample meat for a small tribe.</p><p>Meanwhile, the elephant’s fat, bones, marrow, and skin could be fashioned into tools as well.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-395791 alt="Israeli Ancient Elephant Tusk" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/israeli-ancient-elephant-tusk.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-395791 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Researchers from the Israel Antiquities Authority, Tel Aviv University, and Ben-Gurion University, at the site in southern Israel on Aug. 31, 2022.</span></p><p>Some ancient humans had even fashioned bits of elephants into huts, as evidenced by archaeological research in Siberia.</p><p>Curiously, the unearthed ancient tools found in the region seem far more advanced than those typically employed by Homo erectus, the ancient human species commonly believed to have hunted in the region at the time.</p><p>The newly-discovered tusk in Revadim could help to answer some of the researchers’ biggest questions about the nature of the prehistoric animal itself as well as the early humans who hunted it.</p><p>“Is the tusk the remains of a hunted elephant, or was it collected by the local prehistoric inhabitants? Did the tusk have social or spiritual significance?” Milevski and fellow researcher Ofer Marder of Ben-Gurion University asked.</p><p>To help answer these questions, conserving the large tusk is of “primary importance for the academic community, but also of great public interest,” said the IAA’s director, Eli Eskozido.</p><p>While we wait to see what new insights this elephant tusk might generate, why not learn about the <a href=#>world’s oldest-known brewery</a> found at an ancient Egyptian burial site?
