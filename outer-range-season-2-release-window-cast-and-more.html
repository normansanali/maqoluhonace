He’s also an executive producer for the show alongside creator and writer Brian Watkins. Tom Pelphrey will also continue portraying Abbott’s son, Perry Abbott, while Lili Taylor takes on the role of Abbott’s wife, Cecelia. Joining them as part of the supporting cast are Noah Reid as Billy Tillerson, Imogen Poots as the mysterious drifter Autumn Rivers, Lewis Pullman as Rhett Abbott, Sean Sipos as Luke Tillerson and Tamara Podemski as Deputy Sheriff Joy Hawk.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Prime Video has also announced the expansion of the cast for Season 2 of Outer Range.

In the upcoming season of Outer Range, viewers can expect a gripping continuation of a season that ended with more questions than answers. Despite its concise eight episodes, the season left many mysteries unsolved.&nbsp;Nonetheless, viewers are hoping for much more supernatural elements, which greatly tied the story neatly together.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>Specifically, the mystery of Perry’s missing wife, Rebecca, should come to light. Another significant development from season 1 was the revelation of Autumn’s true identity as the missing Amy Abbott. Moreover, as if things weren’t tense enough already, Royal ends up disclosing his secret to Perry: he is a time traveler, who fell into the void centuries ago.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=false>Altogether, Outer Range season 2 is likely to go in-depth about the nature of the Abbott farm’s time-traveling void: how it works and how it affects the dynamics between the characters. This undoubtedly promises to be a thrilling exploration of time, family, and the unknown.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ywwdOeqWaqkaO0pnnSnpisp55if26%2BxKWcmquVYsSqusOormabkajBbq3NnWSmp6KafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-watch-no-7-penn-state-vs-delaware-on-peacock-this-weekend.html><span>←</span><span>How to watch No. 7 Penn State vs. Delaware football game on Peacock NBC Sports Philadelphia</span></a>
