As the Olympic year unfolds, he aspires to embody the “best version of himself”. In a remarkable show of camaraderie, Kyle Dake extends a wild note of support to this paragon of <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>wrestling</a> excellence.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Kyle Dake’s vote of confidence</strong></h2><p>Recently, Yianni Diakomihalis used <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Instagram to share a heartwarming picture</a> of himself in the company of Kyle Dake and Vito Arujau. He listed five criteria of wrestling dominance, namely, speed, strength, agility, flexibility, and technique. Thereafter, in the captions, he wrote, “Imagine wrestling had video game stats like Madden, we’ve realized Vito and Kyle score REALLY high on this”. This allowed Kyle Dake an opportunity to introspect and come up with a mind-boggling score for Yianni Diakomihalis. The former reposted Diakomihalis’ picture, with a caption of his own, saying, “If I have a 98 on speed I think Vito will have 97… and Yianni is 99”. Kyle Dake’s vital assessment of his wrestling skills repertoire has bolstered Yianni Diakomihalis’ pride.</p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Kyle-Dake.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Yianni Diakomihalis never lacked confidence, but he could not be <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>flagrant of his abilities when facing a lineup</a> of stalwart figures.
