The young actor was announced as the lead role in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">James Gunn’s</a> upcoming <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Superman: Legacy</a> and as expected, the director has decided to choose a younger actor for the role. But just how young is he, exactly?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>Corenswet was born on July 8, 1993, making him 29 years old currently, although he’ll be in his early thirties (the same age as Cavill in Man of Steel) by the time the cameras start rolling for the first official DCU movie since Snyder’s era. Arguably, he is the perfect age for someone who will likely carry the franchise for the next decade or so.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-corenswet-s-portfolio-so-far data-injectable=false>Corenswet’s portfolio so far</h2><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=769 data-injectable=true>Being a relatively fresh face in the industry, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">there are doubts that Corenswet has the experience to take on such a super role.</a> However, despite this, he has been busy acquiring a multitude of roles under his belt. He began acting at a young age with his first stage performance at the age of nine. In 2011 he wrote the screenplay for and starred in a short film before working on a comedy sketch series.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>His first major break was in the 2018 political thriller, Affairs of State followed by appearances in House of Cards, Elementary and The Politician. However, his most noteworthy role is pretty recent as Corenswet starred opposite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mia Goth</a> in Pearl as the projectionist/future husband of the X villain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/pearl.jpg><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>All this is to say that despite his youth, David Corenswet is far from wet behind the ears. He’s not too young for the role but he’s not too old either. Whilst <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Henry Cavill</a> is far from what you’d consider to be old (he’s only 40) it’s worth bearing in mind that Gunn wants a frontman who can lead the franchise into the future. Would Henry Cavill really still want to play Superman when he’s in his fifties? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Downey Jr</a> quit being Iron Man when he was 53 and it took boatloads of money to keep him coming back long before that.</p><h2 id=h-could-he-lead-a-cinematic-universe-despite-his-age data-injectable=false>Could he lead a cinematic universe despite his age?</h2><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>So yes, whilst Corenswet may be very young for someone in a role such as this. That doesn’t take away from more than a decade of acting experience in front of a camera and two decades of experience if you count his stage performances and all before turning 30.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=false>On top of this, Superman’s character in the comics is quite young. While there is no definitive accepted age, Clark Kent/Kal-El is usually estimated to be late twenties or early thirties. Corenswet fits neatly in the middle of that bracket so the actor is certainly a solid choice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMqKOdZZmoeqWt1aKbZpufp7Kvv9aeq2ack6h6r7HWZqquqJWnuqK6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wendy-zuckerman.html><span>←</span><span>Hire Wendy Zuckerman to Speak at Events</span></a>
