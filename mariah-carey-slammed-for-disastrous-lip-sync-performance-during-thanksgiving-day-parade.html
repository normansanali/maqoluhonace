One of the fans wrote, “Respect to Mariah Carey for not even pretending not to lip sync.” Another fan wrote, “After that disastrous lip sync, it’s only fitting that Mariah Carey’s trademark attempt to become the official Queen of Christmas was rejected. Yikes.” Another listener tweeted, “So we’re just supposed to pretend like Mariah Carey is actually singing All I Want For Christmas live right now? Terrible lip sync.”<br>“Mariah Carey just did the worst lip sync job of all time.. how you ruin Christmas in November,” wrote another fan. “This Mariah Carey lip sync might go down as the worst attempt in history. I don’t think her mic was even on, her face certainly wasn’t moving,” said another listener.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Respect to Mariah Carey for not even pretending not to lip sync</p>— Andy Kalmowitz (@andy_witz) <a href=#>November 24, 2022</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>After that disastrous lip sync, it’s only fitting that Mariah Carey’s trademark attempt to become the official Queen of Christmas was rejected.
