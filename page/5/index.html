Officially, this is a relic of the 15th century, when local bishops and other town authorities banned public dancing and begging for money during public holidays. The story goes that border dancers in the 1450s blackened their faces to avoid identification and to give the local sheriff an excuse not to arrest them later on the grounds that he “couldn’t identify” people from his own village who were wearing soot on their faces.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who was Kimberly Hoffman?
