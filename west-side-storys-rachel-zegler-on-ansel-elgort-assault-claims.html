Nearly two years after <a href=#><strong>Ansel Elgort</strong></a> was accused of sexual assault, his&nbsp;<i>West Side Story&nbsp;</i>costars — including leading lady <a href=#><strong>Rachel Zegler</strong></a> — are opening up about the allegations.</p><p class=p1>“We made a movie two and a half years ago, and a lot has gone on in the world since then,” Zegler, 20, told&nbsp;<i><a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;</i>in an interview published on Wednesday, January 26. “A lot has changed very publicly, and privately as well. There’s been a lot of awakening.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/West-Side-Storys-Rachel-Zegler-Addresses-Sexual-Assault-Allegations-Against-Costar-Ansel-Elgort.jpg><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Shazam! Fury of the Gods&nbsp;</i>star continued: “You just hope that the people involved are OK, that they are asked in a respectful manner and that they are given the opportunity to answer for themselves.”</p><p class=p1>In addition to Zegler, who <a href=#>played Maria to the 27-year-old&nbsp;<i>Fault in Our Stars</i>&nbsp;star’s Tony</a>, other&nbsp;<i>West Side Story&nbsp;</i>actresses similarly addressed the scandal during their joint interview.</p><p class=p1>“Nobody really knows what’s going on in anyone’s head. Only the people who were involved in that situation know what actually went down,” <a href=#><strong>Ariana DeBose</strong></a>, who played Anita in the 2021 film, told the magazine.</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Rita Moreno</strong></a>, for her part, noted: “I think it would have been absolutely horrendous and wrong for anyone to take sides in that matter. It’s not for me to make those judgments.”</p><p class=p1>In June 2020, Elgort was <a href=#>accused of assaulting a woman</a> when she was 17. The alleged victim shared a lengthy Twitter note, detailing the allegations at the time, in which she claimed that when she met up with the Ansolo musician in 2014, “instead of asking me if I wanted to stop having sex knowing it was my first time,” he forced himself on her and “made me think this is how sex was supposed to be.”</p><p class=p1>The <i>Baby Driver </i>actor <a href=#>publicly denied the allegations</a> via social media weeks later, claiming that he was “distressed” by the things he saw “circulating” online about his past.</p><p class=p1>Elgort continued: “I cannot claim to understand Gabby’s feelings but her description of events is simply not what happened. I have never and would never assault anyone.”</p><p class=p1>The New York native, who is currently dating&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Violetta Komyshan</strong></a>, went on to claim that he and his accuser had a “brief, legal and entirely consensual relationship” in 2014.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Unfortunately, I <a href=#>did not handle the breakup well</a>. I stopped responding to her, which is an immature and cruel thing to do to someone. I know this belated apology does not absolve me of my unacceptable behavior when I disappeared,” Elgort continued in his June 2020 post. “As I look back at my attitude, I am disgusted and deeply ashamed of the way I acted. I am truly sorry. I know I must continue to reflect, learn, and work to grow in empathy.”</p><p class=p1>Elgort and Zegler began filming&nbsp;<i>West Side Story&nbsp;</i>in July 2019, but the film’s release was <a href=#>delayed until December 2021</a> amid <a href=#>the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawnaOperS1w55krKyfp8a0edGamqGdnGLHprPLnqlmp55irq%2B%2FxKVknqSXpL%2B1ecCsqpqtnKl6pLjAoqSsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-three-musketeers-remake-cast-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Three Musketeers Is Being Retold In Two New Movies With A Surprising Cast</span></a>
