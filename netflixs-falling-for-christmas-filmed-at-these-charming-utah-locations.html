It’s shown in transition shots from above with partiers in the roof pool, and the lobby is featured when love interest Jake (Chord Overstreet,) crashes into the Belmont heiress, Sierra (Lindsay Lohan,) and spills coffee on her outfit.</p><p>When Avy (Olivia Perez,) Jake’s daughter in the film, makes her special Christmas wish at the Christmas market, those scenes were shot around <a href=#>Gardner Village</a> in West Jordan, Utah. The Village is featured again following the tree lighting ceremony.</p><p>Jake’s “North Star Lodge” was filmed at two different locations. The interior was filmed&nbsp;at the <a href=# rel=noopener>Goldener Hirsch Inn</a>, which is next to the aforementioned Residences at Goldener Hirsch. Both buildings are part of Deer Valley’s Silver Lake Village.</p><p>However, the exterior scenes were filmed&nbsp;outside <a href=#>Blue Boar Inn</a>, a quaint hotel in Midway, Utah. It’s charming European Chateau vibe and lower profile location was perfect for Jake’s family-owned Christmas Inn aesthetic.</p><p>A lot of the outdoor scenes that include sweeping views and snow covered mountaintops were filmed in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah. Including the spot where Tad (George Young,) proposed to Sierra before her dangerous tumble down the mountainside.</p><p>The classic formulaic story and physical humor will have you wondering if you’re laughing at the tumbles or the poor acting but “Falling for Christmas” is a fun Christmas movie for the whole family. To no surprise of the viewer, Sierra (Lohan,) finds herself, finds the guy, and the Christmas spirit by the end.</p><p><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# data-size=large data-show-count=false>Follow @KSL5TV</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijo6HBt3rCqKRobWFohHN9jqecrZ6cnsW0ecWao6Whnpx6p7vRZpqhqpmowa6t0madoqSdmrFurdNmq6Gdo5p6pLTAq6SippdiwrWtx2ajqJuRqbawutJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miroslava-net-worth-310611.html><span>←</span><span>Miroslava Net Worth</span></a>
