The storage capabilities are identical to the Z390-E Gaming with two PCIe 3.0 x4 capable M.2 slots, with only one offering SATA support; the main difference is the Strix Z390-F Gaming has a single M.2 heatsink. The Strix Z390-F Gaming has six SATA ports in total which support RAID 0, 1, 5 and 10 arrays. There are four available RAM slots which support DDR4-4266 and with up to a maximum of 64 GB in total.</p><p>What we do know about the rear panel is that it has a single LAN port powered by an Intel I219V Gigabit controller and five 3.5 mm jacks, with a single S/PDIF optical output which takes direction from a SupremeFX S1220A HD audio codec. Also included are three USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-A ports, one USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-C port, a DisplayPort and HDMI video output too.</p><p>The current availability and pricing of the ASUS ROG Strix Z390-F are currently unknown, but as more details and information becomes available, we will ensure to keep this section updated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH50gI9wZqKmpJq5bsaScmdmpZ%2Bptaa%2BwaiYq5xdpMOmvtWinLBllauys8WMpqatoJWnr7Ct0Z1kmqaRoca7scNoaWo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1422036-andrade-el-idolo-vs-joey-janela-announced-for-gcw-highest-in-the-room-2.html><span>←</span><span>Andrade El Idolo vs. Joey Janela Announced For GCW Highest In The Room 2</span></a>
