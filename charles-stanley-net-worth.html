A well-known pastor who has also made a name in media being a television show host, Charles has been active in his profession since 1971.</p><p>A successful author and a televangelist whose show is viewed by millions of people in America, one may wonder how rich is Charles Stanley? As of early 2016, Charles counts his net worth at the amount of $1.5 million.

Two years later, Stanley went to work at the Christian ministry where he has been working since. Charles attended the University of Richmond, and then Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary to earn a Master of Divinity degree. He also has a doctorate, a Th.D. in theology from Luther Rice Seminary. Stanley started his career on the staff of the First Baptist Church of Atlanta in 1969, where he later became a senior pastor.</p><p>Inspired by the book “Think And Grow Rich”, Stanley went on to launch a religious program called “The Chapel Hour” in 1972, in which he served as the host. Later, he continued being a host, of another religious show “The Breakfast Club” which aired between 1983 and 1985. Again, in 1990 Charles went on to launch his own show “In Touch With Dr. Charles Stanley” which has now been on air for more than 25 years. Needless to say, these television appearances have not only helped Charles promote his theology and Christianity, but have also helped him amass his net worth over the years.</p><p>Apart from being a well-received pastor, Charles is also a well-known author who writes for a free magazine entitled “In Touch”. His writings are mostly based on finance, relationships, parenting and emotional crises. He has also appeared in several podcasts and television shows as a guest, such as “Praise The Lord” and “19 Kids And Counting”. Of course these are some of the outlets that Charles uses to advocate his theologies and his belief in protestant Christianity.</p><p>Talking about his personal life, Charles is a divorcee. His marriage of 40 years with his wife Anna J. Stanley ended in divorce in 2000 after some years of separation. Charles is a father a son and a daughter, and his son, Andy Stanley is also a pastor at North Point Community Church.
