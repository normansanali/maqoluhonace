 Answer
Audiences may remember that the main character was forced to use a wheelchair after snowboarding from an escarpment while working. This all happened before he met Bonnie, as you can see. Casting William as Adam, despite the fact that he does not use a wheelchair in real life, sparked outrage on social media from those both inside and beyond the disability community.
 
Similarly, some people wonder whether the actor who portrays Adam on Mom is really crippled."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
