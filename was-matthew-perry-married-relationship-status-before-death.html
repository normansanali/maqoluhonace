The <i>Friends</i> actor became one of the biggest names in Hollywood thanks to his role as Chandler Bing on the sitcom from 1994 to 2004, and he was linked to many A-list women, including <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Julia Roberts</b></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Valerie Bertinelli</b></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Lizzy Caplan</b></a>, and more.</p><p class=p1>Keep reading to learn about his love life before his sudden passing.</p><h2 class=p1>Who Was Matthew Perry Dating?</h2><p class=p1>The<i> 17 Again</i> actor appeared to be single at the time of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his death</a>. He was reportedly found dead from an apparent drowning in a jacuzzi at his Los Angeles home, according to TMZ.</p><p class=p1>His last public relationship was with literary agent <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Molly Hurwitz</b></a>. The pair began dating in 2018 and even got engaged in 2020 before ultimately calling it quits one year later.</p><p class=p1>“Sometimes things just don’t work out and this is one of them. I wish Molly the best,” Matthew said in a statement to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>People</i></a> in June 2021.</p><h2 class=p1>Was Matthew Perry Married?</h2><p class=p1>Matthew was never married, and Molly was the only girlfriend he was ever publicly engaged to.</p><p class=p1>His longest relationship was with <i>Mean Girls</i> actress Lizzy Caplan. The pair broke up in 2012 after six years together, and Matthew said in his 2022 memoir, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</i></a>, that they almost got engaged during their time together.</p><p class=p1>“All my fears reared up like a snake,” he wrote about their breakup. “I often think if I’d asked [her to marry me], now we’d have two kids and a house. Instead, I’m some schmuck who’s alone in his house at 53.”</p><p class=p1>Perhaps his most famous love affair was with Julia Roberts. They dated for a few months in 1996 and were a real life couple when she appeared on season 2 of <i>Friends</i>. Matthew ultimately ended their relationship, which he detailed in his book.</p><p class=p1>“Dating Julia Roberts had been too much for me. I had been constantly certain that she was going to break up with me. Why would she not? I was not enough; I could never be enough; I was broken, bent, unlovable,” he wrote. “So instead of facing the inevitable agony of losing her, I broke up with the beautiful and brilliant Julia Roberts.”</p><p class=p1>He joked, “She might have considered herself slumming it with a TV guy, and TV guy was now breaking up with her. I can’t begin to describe the look of confusion on her face.”</p><h2 class=p1>Did Matthew Perry Have Kids?</h2><p class=p1>Matthew did not have any children, but he talked fondly about the idea of having a family before his death.</p><p class=p1>He told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>People</i></a> in October 2022 that he thought he would make a “great” dad, adding, “I grew up with a lot of little kids around me, and that’s probably why, but I can’t wait.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5xe5FyZrCZo2K6osDToZywZaCav7PFjKaYq6qZmrFuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZqqtmaSqwG6uxJ%2Bmq51dmbKiwMdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-crown-late-queen-mourned-sister-pricess-margaret.html><span>←</span><span>The Crown: how the late Queen mourned her beloved sister Princess Margaret</span></a>
