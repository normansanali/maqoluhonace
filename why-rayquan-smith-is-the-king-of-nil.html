Norfolk State’s Rayquan Smith has taken full advantage of this rule change and become one of the most successful student-athletes in the realm of NIL deals. He’s been dubbed the “King of NIL” for good reason.</p><p>Smith’s success in signing NIL deals is impressive, especially considering that he attends a small college with just over 5,000 students. Despite this, he’s landed around 80 endorsement deals and has generated a profit “well into the five-figures” in less than a year. His partnerships include big-name brands such as G.O.A.T. Fuel, Arby’s, Champs Sports, Body Armour, and even the Norfolk Admirals hockey team.</p><p>So, what’s the secret to Smith’s success? According to him, it’s all about perseverance and belief in oneself. He found his marketing moniker “King of NIL” on Twitter and has since encouraged other small-market athletes to take advantage of the opportunity to market themselves. Smith hatched a plan, sending out emails to companies asking to promote their products and even offered his services for free.</p><p>But it’s not just Smith’s persistence that has led to his success. He has also demonstrated an ability to create unique content that helps market his partners’ brands. Despite suffering a Lisfranc injury in football and being unable to compete in track, Smith has attracted most of his partners due to his ability to create content that stands out from the rest.</p><p>Smith’s success has not gone unnoticed. He’s become somewhat of a celebrity in the world of <a href=#>college sports</a>, with many referring to him as the “King of NIL”. At just 21 years old, he’s already signed around 70 endorsement deals in the past year alone. The fact that Smith attends a smaller college has only added to his allure, as it shows that NIL deals aren’t reserved solely for athletes at large universities.</p><p>The NCAA’s ruling on NIL deals has been a long time coming, and it has the potential to revolutionize college sports. For years, <a href=#>student-athletes</a> have been unable to profit off their own name and likeness, despite the fact that their universities and the NCAA have been making millions off their performances. This ruling finally gives these athletes the ability to earn some of the money they rightfully deserve.</p><p>Smith’s success is just the tip of the iceberg. With the new NIL rule, we’re likely to see many more student-athletes who are able to profit off their own brand. It’s an exciting time in the world of college sports, and Smith is leading the way.</p><p>In conclusion, Rayquan Smith has become the face of the new era of college sports with the passing of the <a href=#>NCAA’s</a> NIL rule. Smith’s success has been due to his perseverance, unique content creation and belief in himself. He has become a celebrity in the college sports world, and his success has shown that NIL deals are not reserved for athletes at large universities. The future of college sports is bright, and Smith is leading the way as the “King of NIL.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn7JlopbGssHAp2SspZmptW610maroZ1doLavs4yonWammaE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-lynn-faulds-wood-son-nicholas-stapleton-everything-on-the-family-of-the-presenter-who-died-from-cancer-233529-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Lynn Faulds Wood Son Nicholas Stapleton?
