The Oscar-nominated actor’s latest film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">You People</a> is currently dominating the streaming charts. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Flix Patrol</a>, the romantic comedy is the #1 movie on <a data-wpil=url href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>.</p><p>Co-written and directed by Kenya Barris (Blash-ish, Grown-ish), You People centers on an interracial couple and how their families reckon with modern love amid culture clashes, societal expectations and generational differences. The cast is absolutely stacked with A-list talent. In addition to Eddie Murphy, the film stars Jonah Hill, Lauren London, David Duchovny, Nia Long, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Sam Jay, Deon Cole, Travis Bennett, and Molly Gordon.</p><p>The movie was announced in June 2021, with Jonah Hill attached as the star and Kenya Barris on board as director. Eddie Murphy joined the cast in August of the same year, and by November, the casting process was pretty much completed. You People was released in select theaters by Netflix on January 20, 2023, ahead of its January 27 premiere on the streaming service.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/eddie-murphy-jonah-hill-you-people-900x497.png><p><a href=#>Jonah Hill</a> has been heavily involved with the project since its conception, having co-scribed the screenplay with Kenya Barriss. Although filming on the movie seemed to go off without a hitch, the 39-year-old actor was noticeably absent from press campaigns for the feature. Of course, his lack of media appearances to promote the film wasn’t unexpected, announcing in a social media post last August that he wouldn’t be making the press rounds for any of his upcoming projects.</p><p>While filming the documentary Strutz, the Moneyball star came to the realization that he has spent nearly two decades suffering from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety attacks</a> that are often triggered by media appearances. Jonah Hill opted to step back from promoting You People and all his future projects in an effort to protect himself. Fortunately, fellow cast members Lauren London, Eddie Murphy, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus seemed to support the actor’s decision.</p><p>Speaking of the cast of You People, critics have heaped praise on their solid performances in the film. Sadly, in general, the movie didn’t seem to land with viewers. The feature has been blasted for its stale jokes and messy storyline.</p><p>On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 43 percent from 92 reviews by critics. From everyday viewers, it has a score of 39 percent. According to the Chicago Tribune’s Michael Phillips, without Eddie Murphy and his “deadpan, steely reactions to the latest affront, You People would be all strain and little gain.”</p><p>Still, the negative reviews haven’t kept the film from zipping to the top of Netflix’s most-streamed movies. You People currently sits ahead of high-profile movies like Minions: The Rise of Guru, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, and Bullet Train. Of course, with several new titles hitting the streamer February 1st, the film’s time in the #1 spot may be short-lived.</p><p>With that said, Eddie Murphy is set to return as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Axel Foley</a> in the long-awaited fourth installment in the Beverly Hills Cop franchise, which is also being developed as a Netflix exclusive. Although story details are scarce at this time, anticipation for the sequel is at an all-time high. Directed by Mark Molloy from a screenplay by Josh Appelbaum, Will Beall, and Andre Nemec, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley is scheduled to premiere later this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2idlJm2pnnMrqmpoKmoerq71GannqegobJvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mad-fut-21-draft-pack-opener.html><span>←</span><span>Download MAD FUT 21 Draft Pack Opener for iOS - Free</span></a>
