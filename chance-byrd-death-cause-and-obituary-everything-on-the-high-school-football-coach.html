Prior to his death, no serious accident, injury, or disease was reported as he was still continuing his job as a coach.</p><p>Thus, not much can be said about the late Bryd’s death until his close ones come forward explaining the situation.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chance-byrd-age-and-wikipedia-explored></span>Chance Byrd Age And Wikipedia Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chance Byrd’s age appears to be around his early 30s by scanning through his pictures. Meanwhile, the exact details of his birth date are not on display.</p><p>Considering his age, he passed away at a very young age as a bright future for him in coaching was awaiting for sure.</p><p>Likewise, not much of his early life background has been shared with the public. It is sure that he started as a player of both football and baseball when he was a student.</p><p>He then took on coaching children especially at the high school level and was chosen by the well-known Lincoln High School as their coach.</p><p>The news of his death has been covered by Anniston Star though his close ones have been pouring their condolences on many social media platforms.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=know-his-family-details></span>Know His Family Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chance Byrd had an amazing family who supported him throughout his life.
