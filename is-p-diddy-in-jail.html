Diddy is not in jail for any of the suits mentioned. So far, Diddy has only faced civil suits, which, as opposed to a criminal lawsuit, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t result in prison sentences</a>. While litigating one of Combs’ suits, prosecutors may find ample evidence to bring criminal charges against Combs related to the civil suits and then prosecute Combs on those charges. And if Combs and his legal team were to violate court orders, that might also result in jail time.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>Diddy’s ongoing legal problems are not the first faced by the mogul. In 2015, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> reported that Combs was briefly behind bars for an alleged assault at a gym. Combs was released on bail, and the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office chose not to file charges.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX57AbryMnaCdnKlitq95yZqgpWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-ran-off-with-intels-tiger-lake-wafer-who-wants-a-die-shot.html><span>←</span><span>I Ran Off with Intels Tiger Lake Wafer.
