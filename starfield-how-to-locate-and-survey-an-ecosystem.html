Then, they need to figure out the planet’s Traits</strong>. Only after that will the ecosystem count as discovered and complete a mission set by Constellation.</p><p data-injection=true>We spent a long time trying to figure this out and have some tips to help players blast their way through these missions quickly. For us, the mission we were trying to complete was “<strong>Locate a Charred Ecosystem in the Alpha Tirna System</strong>.”</p><p><strong>These missions are all different for every player because they’re procedurally generated</strong>. However, the format and solutions are all the same. That’s why the tips below will help any player struggling with one of these missions get to the end of it quickly.</p><h2>Land in Multiple Locations and Scan Everything</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rock-pile-starfield.jpg><p>To locate an ecosystem in Starfield, it’s best to start by scanning everything on the planet. This means finding every resource, flora, and fauna and scanning them all to 100%. The easiest way to do this is to land in multiple locations and scan everything nearby.</p><p data-injection=true>Resources are pretty easy to scan, but for flora and fauna, players may need to put in some legwork and track down every type of creature that exists. This can be&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">made faster</a>&nbsp;by following hunters and tracking all the creatures that pop up around them as they go about their business.</p><h2>Search Caves for Rare Resources</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/caves-in-starfield.jpg><p data-injection=true>The rarest resources in Starfield are tough to find on a planet’s surface. However, they’re usually pretty abundant in caves. We find that if there’s one rare resource we’ve yet to find, looking inside a cave usually sorts us out. Starfield seems to like hiding these elements away from prying eyes to make them feel scarcer, but they’re just as common if players know where to look.</p><p>Caves are also just a great place to find some of the more flavorful environmental storytelling Bethesda has sprinkled into the game. For example, we found a cave that had turrets set up everywhere. After fighting through them, the camp we found was modest. It seemed that a miner had been doing his own thing and sleeping in the cave, enjoying a boo on the founder of Chunks every night.</p><h2>Look for Geological Features to Unlock Traits</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/geological-featuree-ocean-deposits-starfield.jpg><p>Geological features are all linked to planet Traits. It’s easy to see how many Traits a planet has from the planetary map. The one we were exploring had three. To find these geological features, players must visit unknown landmarks in the distance while exploring. These almost always turn out to be a geological feature, and fully scanning them unlocks a Trait.</p><p>We had to land in three different areas and visit unknown landmarks at each one to unlock all three Traits for the planet we were exploring. The features we surveyed were <strong>Deep Ocean Deposits</strong>, <strong>Sinister Terraces</strong>, and a <strong>Meteorite Crater</strong>.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72721fa3ecb7cd425c8e9e789734b801?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Jamie Moorcroft-Sharp</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Jamie Moorcroft-Sharp is a Staff Writer at Gamepur.
