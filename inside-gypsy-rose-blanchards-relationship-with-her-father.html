According to <a href=#>BuzzFeed News</a>, Dee Dee claimed that Gypsy's father was an alcoholic and drug user. She also told friends that Gypsy Rose's father mocked her disabilities and never sent monetary support. After Dee Dee's murder, however, the truth was revealed.</p><p dir=ltr>Rod met 24-year-old Dee Dee while he was 17 years old and still in high school. They had been dating for a few months when she became pregnant. According to Rod, he thought the best course of action to take was to marry Dee Dee. However, he said that he later realized that he didn't love her, and they divorced. Rod said that Gypsy was born a healthy baby, but Dee Dee claimed she had sleep apnea when she was just 3 months old. As reported by the <a href=#>Springfield News-Leader</a>, more and more health issues arose as time went by, which made Rod suspicious. That was when Dee Dee decided to move from Louisiana to Springfield with Gypsy, most likely to prevent Rod and their families from knowing the truth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFk29rcm1fnru0tcOeZKCxoKjGbr7OrJxmmpyWu6S0wKubrGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6uLXToWShnaJis6LAx56paA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-acer-nitro-5-review-renoir-and-turing-on-a-budget.html><span>←</span><span>GPU Performance - The Acer Nitro 5 Review: Renoir And Turing On A Budget</span></a>
