With that distinction, she became the very first Indigenous nominee in that category, though she does follow in the footsteps of Irene Bedard, who was nominated for her 1994 role in the TV movie&nbsp;Lakota Woman: Siege at Wounded Knee (her category was Best Performance by an Actress in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, or a Motion Picture Made for Television). And while she would also make history with a win, Gladstone is up against some stiff competition, including Carey Mulligan, Greta Lee, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Cailee Spaeny</a>, Annette Bening, and Sandra Hüller.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When she arrived on the red carpet tonight at the 2024 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Golden Globes</a> ceremony, Gladstone wore a white strapless Valentino gown with a dramatic, contrasting black opera coat. During her time on the red carpet — she had co-star Leonardo DiCaprio on her arm — she said the look echoed her Cannes ensemble, which was also by the storied Italian fashion house. Gladstone added a touch of Indigenous design to her look with earrings from Blackfeet designer Lenise Omeaso of Antelope Women Designs. Gladstone grew up on a Blackfeet reservation in Montana, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>The Oklahoman</a>. DiCaprio also had a nod to the film, adding a small pin with the symbol of the Osage Nation to his tuxedo.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kevin Mazur/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the nominations were announced, Gladstone shared a touching message which highlighted the Osage Nation and her fellow cast members and the crew behind the film, including director Martin Scorsese and DiCaprio.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I am deeply moved that the Golden Globes is recognizing our film and the Osage heart behind it. We could never have brought this story to life without the personal contributions of the Osage Nation, and I’ll be forever grateful to them and every member of the cast and crew. These nominations shine a light on the memory of&nbsp;Mollie Burkhart&nbsp;and all the Osage women and men who lived and died during the Reign of Terror. They are the emotional core of&nbsp;Killers of the Flower Moon, and we honor them," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she said</a>. "It is especially meaningful to be recognized today alongside the great&nbsp;Marty,&nbsp;Bob, and&nbsp;Leo. The experience of working with these inspiring artists can barely be put into words. Their commitment, dedication and generosity have enriched my life in countless ways. I am so honored to have been entrusted with this story that belongs to the Osage nation, and so deeply grateful to the Golden Globes for seeing me, and our film which means so much to Native American and Indigenous people around the world.”<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ANGELA WEISS / AFP</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to speaking about the importance of indigenous representation on the big screen, Gladstone has championed indigenous designers during previous red carpet outings, as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When she attended the Time 100 Next Gala in October 2023, she wore an printed two-piece set by&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Burning Wagon Designs</a>, which was created by Osage women. The coordinating skirt and top featured a Buffalo nickel print and she finished the look with a coat from Hermès. The mix of major fashion players and indigenous design is her M.O. on the carpet. Working with stylist Jason Rembert, Gladstone has worn labels like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, and Marni and accessorized the looks with earrings from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Weomepe Designs</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Jennifer Younger</a>, and &nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>El Techichi</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>See More</span></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6KjsmWXoa6lv9OopZ5ll6S5pbHNZp6lp5KawG5%2Bj2trZqqVmXqkrdGpnK1laGl%2Bd32Saw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-tesh-net-worth-age-health-height-songs-and-children.html><span>←</span><span>John Tesh Net Worth, Age, Health, Height, Songs And Children</span></a>
