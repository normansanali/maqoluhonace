(Swift and Healy were first linked in 2014 but didn’t confirm the romance rumors at the time.)</p><p>“Was any of it true? Gazing at me starry-eyed in your Jehovah’s Witness suit,” Swift sings on “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,” seemingly taking aim at the suit and tie Healy often performs in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/How-Matty-Healy-Feels-About-Tortured-Poets-Department-2-Months-After-Release-2.jpg><p>Swift also recalls public backlash to a relationship on TTPD, seemingly clapping back at those who criticized her for dating Healy after he made problematic comments about<strong> Ice Spice</strong>. (Ice Spice, 24, later told Billboard that <a href=#>Healy had apologized</a> “a bunch of times” for his remarks.)</p><p>“God save the most judgmental creeps who say they want what’s best for me / Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I’ll never see / Thinking they can change the beat of my heart when he touches me and counteract the chemistry,” she sings on “But Daddy I Love Him.”</p><p>Healy, for his part, gave fans a brief insight into <a href=#>his thoughts on the album</a> in April when he was stopped by a reporter and asked, “How would you rate your Taylor diss track compared to the 30 others?”</p><p>Healy began to laugh in the video obtained by Entertainment Tonight and replied, “I haven’t really listened to that much of it but I’m sure it’s good.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite appearing unfazed by the album, a source exclusively told Us last month that Healy is “<a href=#>uncomfortable with the renewed attention</a> on his relationship [with Taylor] — especially because he’s [with someone] new.”</p><p>Healy has been dating model <strong>Gabbriette Bechtel</strong> since September 2023. He and Swift called off their brief romance that June.</p><p>For more on Healy and Swift, watch the video above and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp6diuqLA07JkoZ2RocZussSeo6xlkZe8tsCMraupnF2ivK%2FAx6xkpZmkmr9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-how-much-jay-hernandez-is-really-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Here's How Much Jay Hernandez Is Really Worth</span></a>
