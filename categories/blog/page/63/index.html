As his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, has gotten more serious with boyfriend Pete Davidson, Kanye West has not been shy about showing off his new romance with Chaney Jones on social media.

The Droid 2 uses the same 3.7” 240 PPI IPS screen as the original Droid. In fact, the front of the device seems almost unchanged. The panel is the same, as is Corning gorilla glass. I measured the original Droid and found the display very contrasty and very high PPI due to the smaller size. Again, Motorola uses a relatively unique 854x480 resolution where the norm appears to be 800x480 for most other Android 2.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Maite Lanata Net Worth 2024</h2><time>Aug 30, 2024</time>
