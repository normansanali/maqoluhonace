<a href=../../../../every-upcoming-movie-in-sonys-spider-man-universe-explained.html></a>
After the complete travesty that was Morbius, Sony must be desperate to compete with Marvel’s slate of upcoming titles. While we’d argue that Sony have Marvel beat as far as animated movies and shows (Spider-Verse trilogy, hello?), it’s still safe to say that Marvel is the standout in all other areas, even if the MCU as a whole has left a bad taste in people’s mouths lately. We won’t be so hasty as to chalk Morbius‘ failure up to Jared Leto, as it was certainly a team effort (or lack thereof) from Sony, but there’s some exciting movies on the way from the conglomerate, so we’ll assume that Morbius will be the bad seed of the bunch and keep our hopes up.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Fred Warner Net Worth 2024: What Is The San Francisco 49ers Linebacker Worth?</h2><time>Sep 8, 2024</time>
