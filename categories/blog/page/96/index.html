<a href=../../../../intel-euvenabled-7nm-process-tech-is-on-track.html></a>
Originally planned to enter mass production in the second half of 2016, Intel’s 10 nm process technology is still barely used by the company today. Currently the process is used&nbsp;to produce just a handful of CPUs, ahead of an&nbsp;expected ramp to high-volume manufacturing (HVM) only later in 2019. Without a&nbsp;doubt, Intel suffered delays on its 10 nm process by several years, significantly impacting&nbsp;the company's product lineup and its business.
Now, as it turns out, Intel’s 10 nm may be a short-living node as the company’s 7 nm tech is on-track for introduction in accordance with its original schedule.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Former MLB pitcher, TJ House publicly announces his engagement to his longtime partner and comes out</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>

Another day’s at end
Mama says she’s tired again
No one can even begin to tell her
I hardly know what to say
But maybe it’s better that way
If poppa were here I’m sure he’d tell her
Shannon is gone I heard
She’s drifting out to sea
She always loved to swim away
Maybe she’ll find an island
With a shaded tree
Just like the one in our backyard</article><article class=post-entry><h2>I Made Drakes Nasty Birthday Macaroni and Cheese</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>
