In light of “George Reeves” and “cameo” now sparking a rather off-putting reminder, it might do us good to remember Reeves’ Superman cameo that we can actually all get behind.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=false>Back in 1957, Reeves brought his eponymous Adventures with Superman character over to an episode of I Love Lucy, and as evidenced by the razor-sharp punchline he delivers at the end of the above clip, it’s clear that overwhelmingly positive Superman cameos from Reeves are out there; it’s just imperative that we look beyond The Flash if we wish to find them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonZqmo2LCsb%2FErWSbsV2csrC%2Bxp5kq52Vq7K0ecKapJ6nXZ67bsDHnmSfpJGotW6%2Fx6ispZxdmLmmrc2snGasmJq2s3nPmqOarJWoeri106FkraCZqHq4tM6lnKynnZp6qnnLqK2eZZyqsLp5wKmnnpmilruksY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./henry-cavill-superman-flash-scenes-exclusive-html.html><span>←</span><span>Exclusive: Henry Cavill Shooting Superman Scenes For The Flash</span></a>
