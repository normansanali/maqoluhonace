We planned to sell more than that. </span><span>When Norman Lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly $15 billion to defend sterling, we were amused because that was about how much सwe wanted to sell.”</span></p><p><span>In 1997 at the time of the Asian financial crisis, the P.M. of Malaysia blamed Soros, but when he met Soros, he accepted that it was not him who was responsible for the problem.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Political career</span></h3><p><span>In 2004, George entered Politics and till the election, it was a secret.
