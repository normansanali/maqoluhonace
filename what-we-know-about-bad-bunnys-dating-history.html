The Puerto Rican rapper has been steadily building his brand as <a href=# rel=nofollow>one of the greatest trap and reggaeton musicians in the world</a> since he first started his career in 2013. Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio is famously known for the hit single, Soy Peor, but he didn't stop there. His music has since earned him a worldwide following, and plenty of potential romantic partners, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But the musician was reportedly dating model and fellow singer Gabriela Berlingeri, <a href=# rel=nofollow>whom he met in 2017</a>. The pair have a long and public history together, appearing at events, on red carpets, and even in Bunny's music videos. But after going their separate ways in late 2022, Bad Bunny was linked to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kendall Jenner</a> since early 2023. The pair may have showcased their romance on multiple occasions, solidifying their relationship status, but that hasn't stopped <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bad Bunny from admitting he doesn't see kids and marriage in his future</a>. This is what has reportedly led to <a href=# rel=nofollow>the two parting ways in December 2023</a>.</p><p>Here's everything we know about Bad Bunny's relationship history.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/this-is-what-bad-bunny-was-doing-before-he-got-famous-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Bad Bunny Lived A Very Different Life Before He Was Famous</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Before finding fame with his music, Bad Bunny's lifestyle was less glamorous than what it is now.</span><h2 id=why-is-bad-bunny-39-s-ex-carliz-de-la-cruz-suing-him>Why Is Bad Bunny's Ex Carliz De La Cruz Suing Him?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bad-bunny-movie-premiere.jpg><p>One of Bad Bunny's longest reported relationships was with Carliz De la Cruz. The two dated for five years before parting ways in April 2017. Though they have been broken up for many years at this point, their relationship came back into the conversation <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">due to a lawsuit she filed in mid-2023</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The lawsuit was filed in Puerto Rico and claims that her famous "Bad Bunny, baby" sound bite was used without her permission. Bad Bunny uses the sound bite in two of his most famous songs, "Pa Ti" and "Dos Mil 16." <strong>Bunny previously offered her $2,000 to purchase the recording, but she declined</strong>. She is suing Bunny for $40 million and it appears the case remains ongoing.</p><h2 id=did-bad-bunny-ever-have-a-thing-with-trap-musician-cazzu>Did Bad Bunny Ever Have A Thing With Trap Musician Cazzu</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar53217974.jpg><p>In 2019, Bad Bunny was briefly linked to rapper Cazzu. A photo was shared of the two kissing on stage, which fans took as a confirmation of their relationship. At the time, Bunny was also rumored to be dating Berlingeri, confusing the entire world with the nature of their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a later interview, Cazzu denied that she was in a relationship with Bunny, stating that they were just friends. They "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">shared some moments together</a>," but "became friends. Good friends."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ttweb_bad-bunny-s-10-most-popular-songs-ranked-according-to-spotify-_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Bad Bunny's 10 Most Popular Songs, Ranked (According To Spotify)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Bad Bunny's music holds the record for the biggest streamed artist on Spotify, with billions of streams from his most popular songs.</span><h2 id=did-bad-bunny-ever-date-rosal-iacute-a>Did Bad Bunny Ever Date Rosalía?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/rosalia-1.jpg><p>Bunny had also fueled rumors of a relationship with Spanish-born singer Rosalía in 2019, when he posted pictures of him together, with the caption <strong>"I think I fell in love."</strong></p><p>Although they quickly quashed them, they would later be briefly reignited in February 2021, after the release of their song La Noche De Anoche. In the music video, the two once again got up close and personal, as they told the story of two people with passionate chemistry who can't be together. However, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">nothing ever came from the real-life romance speculation</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=was-gabriela-berlingeri-engaged-to-bad-bunny>Was Gabriela Berlingeri Engaged To Bad Bunny?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bad-bunny-looking-very-happy.jpg><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Berlingeri is a model and jewelry designer</a>, but she has also been featured in some of Bunny’s music. The two met the same month Bad Bunny broke up with Carliz de la Cruz in 2017 and sparked romance rumors immediately. In his surprise 2020 album, Las Que No Iban a Salir, she is credited as a vocalist in his song En Casita, which translates to In a small house.</p><p>Bunny made his red carpet debut with Berlingeri at the Billboard Latin Music Awards in September 2021, where she cheered him on as he walked away with a total of ten trophies.</p><p>In August 2021, fans noticed Berlingeri rocking a diamond stone on her ring finger, in a video that was recorded slyly by Bunny. This sparked rumors that the two had tied the knot, or at least gotten engaged.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Bad Bunny <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">set the record straight on those marriage rumors</a> in an interview with Entertainment Tonight . "No, I'm not that married," he noted, before then saying, "Maybe it can be that (engagement). But I think that weddings and get[ting] married scares me. A lot."</p><p>Though fans have closely watched Bad Bunny and Gabriela Berlingeri's relationship for years and suspected they were happily dating if not engaged, an interview with Bunny in July 2022 poked holes in their theory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Remezcla reported, during an Instagram Live, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bad Bunny seemed to say he wasn't dating Gabriela</a>, instead saying they were <strong>"such close friends, best friends."</strong> What's more, though he admitted the two have chemistry, he didn't specifically say that he and Berlingeri were ever actually together. The statement came merely a month after the two appeared in a music video for Bunny's song Tití Me Preguntó, in which they "were featured getting pretend married."</p><p>Eventually, the couple seemed to quietly split in late 2022 after they seemed to disappear from each other's socials. It wasn't long until Bad Bunny was eventually linked to Kendall Jenner.</p><h2 id=kendall-jenner-and-bad-bunny-dated-in-2023>Kendall Jenner And Bad Bunny Dated In 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kendall-jenner-makes-relationship-with-bad-bunny-instagram-official-as-kris-jenner-pushes-her-to-get-married.jpg><p>Shortly after the rapper's split with Gabriela Berlingeri, Bunny was spotted spending a lot of time with model and reality star Kendall Jenner. This was following <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jenner's split from NBA star Devin Booker</a> in the fall of 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bad Bunny and Kendall were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">spotted on numerous occasions throughout 2023</a>, some of which included some serious PDA, solidifying their status as a couple. The rapper has even referenced Kendall in his music.</p><p>While they appeared to be going strong, Kendall and Bad Bunny's romance did not last. While the reality star has been vocal about her hopes for having a family one day, the rapper wasn't afraid to admit that he doesn't see himself having kids or even getting married in the future, which conflicted with Kendall's past statements.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/th-image-template-20.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kendall Jenner's Modeling Has Earned Her A Massive Net Worth: Here's How Much She's Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kendall Jenner earns millions per year from her brand deals and businesses and it has slowly grown her net worth.</span><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bad Bunny shared his thoughts in an interview with </a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair,</a> published in September 2023.</p><p>Despite Bunny's admission, <a href=# rel=nofollow>he and Kendall didn't stop packing on the affection</a> in public.
