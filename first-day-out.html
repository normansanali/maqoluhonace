This portrays his unconventional lifestyle as he prepares for work. The use of baking soda, pot, and a silver fork implies that he is ready to get into the kitchen to cook up some illicit drugs to sell for cash. His affiliation with illegal activities is further revealed as he mentions he works with “chicken”. This is street slang for drugs, particularly cocaine. Gucci uses a play on words by referring to his room full of drugs and money as the “chicken room” and “basement full of Benjamins”. He goes on to explain that he has a variety of weapons to protect himself, highlighting the dangerous nature of his lifestyle.</p><br><p>Gucci Mane describes his motivation for his illegal activities being to provide for his family as well as his lavish lifestyle. His “baby needs some shoes, aunty needs a purse” and he needs a convertible for summer. Throughout the song, he hints at his wealth by referencing his expensive jewelry and vehicles. His wealth and defiant attitude are further demonstrated by his line “Did you miss me or miss my raps, bitch?” referring to his time spent in jail prior to the release of the song. Overall, the lyrics of “First Day Out” paint a vivid picture of a lifestyle entrenched in illegal activity and the societal pressures which influence it.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I'm starting off my day with a blunt of purp</u><br>I am beginning my day by smoking weed in order to get high</p><br><p><u>No pancakes just a cup of syrup</u><br>I am not eating breakfast, just drinking syrup, which is a slang term for lean or codeine cough syrup mixed with soda and candy</p><br><p><u>Baking soda, pot, and a silver fork</u><br>I have the necessary tools for cooking crack cocaine</p><br><p><u>You already know it's time to go to work</u><br>I am ready to start making and selling drugs</p><br><p><u>I'm back up in the kitchen working with a chicken</u><br>I am cooking cocaine</p><br><p><u>You get 63 grams for like $1250</u><br>I can sell 63 grams of cocaine for $1250</p><br><p><u>50 pounds of purp, 50 pounds of midgy</u><br>I have 50 pounds of high quality marijuana and 50 pounds of lower quality marijuana</p><br><p><u>As soon as it's gone I sell another 60</u><br>As soon as my supply of drugs is gone, I immediately get more to sell</p><br><p><u>My baby need some shoes, my aunty need a purse</u><br>I have family members who are in need of material items, and I use drug money to buy them</p><br><p><u>Summer coming real soon so I need a 'vert</u><br>It is almost summer, so I need to buy a convertible car</p><br><p><u>I hop up out that van with that duffle bag</u><br>I get out of my van with a bag full of drugs</p><br><p><u>And if a nigga try me I'mma bust his ass</u><br>I will use violence against anyone who tries to take my drugs or disrespect me</p><br><p><u>I'm counting up money in my living room</u><br>I am at home counting my drug profits</p><br><p><u>Birds everywhere I call it the chicken room</u><br>My living room is full of drug money, which I refer to as 'birds'</p><br><p><u>Pills in the cabinet, pounds in the den</u><br>I have drugs stored in different places throughout my house</p><br><p><u>Attic full of good, basement full of Benjamins</u><br>I have drugs in my attic and cash stored in my basement</p><br><p><u>Two AK-47s and a blow torch</u><br>I have weapons for protection and a blow torch for cooking drugs</p><br><p><u>Couple junkies knocking hard on my front porch</u><br>Drug addicts are at my door looking to buy drugs</p><br><p><u>A couple old schools in my back yard</u><br>I have a couple of classic cars in my backyard</p><br><p><u>If I don't know ya I'm a serve you through my burglar bars</u><br>If I do not know you, I will sell you drugs through my burglar bars without letting you into my home</p><br><p><u>Gucci back bitch, Yea I'm back bitch</u><br>I am back and making music after being released from jail</p><br><p><u>Did you miss me or miss my raps bitch?</u><br>Are you happy that I am back making music or did you miss me as a person?</p><br><p><u>This that new shit, that county jail shit</u><br>My music is new and reflects my experiences in county jail</p><br><p><u>That seventh floor Rice Street straight out a cell shit</u><br>I am from the seventh floor of the Rice Street jail and my music reflects my time spent in a cell</p><br><p><u>You on my shit list, I'm on the Forbes list</u><br>You are someone I dislike and I am on the Forbes list of wealthiest people</p><br><p><u>Since I'm a rich nigga, I need a rich bitch</u><br>Because I am wealthy, I want to be with a wealthy woman</p><br><p><u>I got sick wrist, it cost 'bout six bricks</u><br>I have expensive jewelry that costs about six bricks of cocaine</p><br><p><u>I'm on that slick shit, that Zone 6 shit</u><br>I am doing well and representing my neighborhood of Zone 6</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Ultra Tunes, Warner Chappell Music, Inc.<br>Written by: Raderic Davis</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maH%2BlmLCqq6yapZ5ndp6%2FtMC%2BfZiyl3%2BqwQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dennis-quaid-early-life-career-age-net-worth-family-wife-marriage-arrest-rumor-and-controversy.html><span>←</span><span>Dennis Quaid: Early Life, Career, Age, Net Worth, Family, Wife, Marriage, Arrest Rumor And Controver</span></a>
