The continuation will reportedly pick up 15 years into the future after the original series left off, opening up a whole new world for the characters that fans came to love over the course of 13 seasons.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>It’s anybody’s best guess what the Hill family will embody in the year 2022 or beyond. Fans have long since speculated <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">whether Hank would have been a Trump voter</a>, however, the latest debate involves matriarch Peggy Hill.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>Peggy, as most are aware, was known for her stubborn wherewithal that occasionally flirted with delusions of grandeur — though, it’s important to note that her character was certainly not a villain of any kind. What made the appeal of King of the Hill so beloved and universally enduring was the very fact that these characters are flawed.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>So, when ScreenRant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">published an op-ed</a> this week titled: “The King Of The Hill Revival Needs To Fix Peggy’s ‘Bad Mom’ Problem,” it went over about as well as can be expected. The following excerpt pointing out Peggy’s apparent “selfishness” and “narcissism” was just one of the arguments the piece makes.</p><p>Most single-family animated comedies showcase each family member’s strong personality (the King of the Hill cast of characters is not short on personality), but they also emphasize the support and love each member feels for one another. Peggy’s selfishness at the expense of her young son and niece is polarizing and diminishes her ability to provide viewers an admirable matriarch in King of the Hill. Peggy’s rehabilitated narcissism would strengthen the show’s reboot by nixing her overused toxicity.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Shortly after the piece was published, Twitter personality Mr. Chau weighed in on the discourse in a tweet that quickly went viral, setting off a debate. “Peggy Hill being a pretty bad mom and wife is more progressive than most shows,” he tweeted. However, the tweet was not necessarily a condemnation of the character, as he later followed up in a second tweet.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Peggy Hill being a pretty bad mom and wife is more progressive than most shows</p>— Mr. Chau (@Srirachachau) <a href=#>March 7, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s insane people are mad I said it’s cool that Peggy Hill is allowed to be the wild card in the family.
