With so many Nike sneakers from her sponsor, she says she loves to share them.</p><p>The <i>Douglas Family Gold</i> star also took us inside her kitchen, but her mom, Natalie Hawkins, tells <i>Us,</i> “Gabrielle doesn’t cook!</p><p>“At all!” Hawkins laughed. “Nothing. Not boiling water, not toasting bread. I mean, she might throw something in the microwave to heat it up. …”</p><p>Since the home tour, Douglas tried to defend her title during the semifinals in Rio. On Sunday, August 7, she missed her chance when teammates Aly Raisman and Simone Biles earned better scores to move on to the finals.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>To learn more about the Olympic champion’s home life, watch the video above!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/gabby-douglas-house-zoom-43743f93-2be4-4999-860b-a8fc074f9e3e.jpg><p>Women’s gymnastics kicked off at the Games Sunday, August 7, at 7 p.m. ET.
