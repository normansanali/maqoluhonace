They don’t want people doing stuff driven by alcohol and the next day waking up and being like: ‘Oh I don’t actually like him, the reason I snogged him is because I was drunk.’ It’s not that kind of show.”</p><p>She went on, saying that “It wouldn’t make sense. They want people kissing and being in bed together because they want to, not because they are drunk.”</p><p><strong>Olivia </strong>did recall being berated from show producers because she called out the strict rules over the alcohol consumption.</p><p>“I questioned them about it every day to the point where they were like: ‘If you ask again, you’re going to get a written warning.’ I was told that in the beach hut because I argued it every day,” she says.</p><p>The newest iteration, Love Island USA season 5 will debut on July 18 on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OvqqGnp5e2u3vOp6OynpGjwG6%2ByJyfZqSZqMFusdKtoKaZpJrAbr7Er5yapF2dvLh5zK6aoWWcpMOmeciso5qmlJq%2FtHnCqKylnF2arrO6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ethan-anka.html><span>←</span><span>Ethan Anka</span></a>
